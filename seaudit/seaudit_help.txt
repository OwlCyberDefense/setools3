Audit Log Analysis Tool for Security Enhanced Linux
seaudit, version 3.0
October 1, 2006
selinux@tresys.com

Overview:
---------
This file contains basic help information for using seaudit, an audit
log analysis tool for Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) audit
messages.  Please report any bugs to setools-bugs@tresys.com.

The tool does not need to be installed on an SELinux system; it will
work in any Linux machine.  The tool parses a given syslog and
extracts all load policy messages, AVC messages and change of Boolean
messages from conditional policies.

The tool has the following main functions:
  1) Browse and sort SELinux audit messages.
  2) Filter an audit log based on fields in the messages.
  3) Query the policy based on data from a given audit message.
  4) Export SELinux audit messages to a file.
  5) Generate reports in HTML or plain-text format from an entire log
     or an seaudit view.


Log and Policy Files:
---------------------
The seaudit program accepts the following command line arguments to
open files at start-up.  Zero, one, or both arguments will be accepted.

  -l[FILE], --log[=FILE]       open log file named FILE
  -p[FILE], --policy[=FILE]    open policy file named FILE

The program provides you with the option of opening either a source or
binary policy file.  If you do not specify a policy to open at the
command line, seaudit will attempt to use the default policy location,
as specified during configuration time (e.g., ./configure
--with-default-policy).

Note that seaudit does not require you to open a policy file; in this
case its functionality will be limited.  For example, you will not be
able to use the query policy features of the tool.  Only one policy
file and one audit log can be open at a time, so if you open another
one of these files the current one will be closed.

If you get a warning when opening a log file that says: "Warning! One
or more invalid messages found in audit log.", this means that one or
more of the SELinux audit messages either was missing a standard
message field (e.g., time, hostname, access type, etc.) or:

  1) A message had an unrecognized time stamp.
  2) An AVC message did not contain permissions.
  3) An AVC message was not labeled as denied or granted.
  4) A load policy message was not in the correct form, (i.e., missing
     a line or a data field).
  5) A Boolean message did not contain a list of Booleans.
    
The seaudit program will still attempt to display the remaining data
from the SELinux audit message in question along with all the other
SELinux messages in the log, but only if one of the following
sub-strings is found within the message:

  "avc:" - indicates an access denied or granted message
  "security:" - indicates a load policy message
  "committed Booleans" - indicates a committed Boolean(s) message.

Otherwise, these messages will not be extracted from the SELinux audit
log.

Menus:
------
The FILE menu allows you to change the current policy file and/or
audit log.  It also shows a list of recently opened files.  The file
menu also allows you to change certain preferences including your
default log and policy files.  You can also set which columns (audit
log data fields) you would like present when you view an audit log, as
well as specify whether you would like seaudit to enable real-time log
monitoring on start-up.  All of these settings will be saved and
reloaded each time seaudit is started.

The VIEW menu allows you to display multiple views of a log.  The
default view is created automatically once an audit log is opened.
Additional views can be created by selecting View->New under the VIEW
menu (or by pressing Ctrl + T).  Each tab can be sorted and filtered
independently.  The 'Save' and 'Save As...' menu items allow you to
save the settings for the view to a file and the 'Export View' menu
item allows you yo export an entire view (i.e., the audit messages
contained in the view) to a file.  Alternatively, you can use the
'Export Selected Messages' menu item to export only selected messages
to a file instead of the entire view.  This menu also provides the
option of viewing an entire audit message within a separate text box
window as it is rendered in the actual audit log.  If multiple audit
messages are selected, seaudit will use the top-most selected audit
message in the current view.

The SEARCH menu allows you to filter the audit log (See Log Views
below) or query the policy (See Query Policy below).

Additionally, right-clicking on an audit message entry will display a
pop-up menu that allows you to:
  - View the entire message within a separate text box.
  - Query the policy using the message.
  - Export all selected messages to a file.

The REPORT menu allows you to create report files in HTML or
plain-text format using an entire audit log or an seaudit view. (See
Creating Reports below).

Sorting:
--------
By default the messages are sorted in chronological order.  To sort by
a particular field click on the column heading.  The only column that
you cannot sort on is the 'Other' column.  Only one level of sorting
can be performed at this time.  The file KNOWN-BUGS describes a
particular instance where the sort order may be misleading.

Log Monitoring: 
---------------
The 'Toggle Monitor' button allows you to turn the real-time log
monitoring feature on or off.  When the monitor is off, the monitor
status label in the lower right-hand corner of the status bar will
display the word 'OFF' in red; however, when the monitor is on the
label will display the word 'ON' in green.  When this feature is on,
seaudit checks for new messages at a regular interval (per second by
default).  This interval can be configured from the Preferences
dialog.  If new messages are found they are displayed according to the
filter and sorting selections for the current view.

Query Policy:
-------------
The 'Query Policy' button opens a new dialog box that contains two
tabs.  The first tab, 'Query Policy', allows you to enter search
criteria similar to that in apol's TE Rules query.  If you have an
audit message highlighted when you click on this button, the search
criteria are filled in based on the message.  Otherwise, all the
criteria are blank.  You may enter regular expressions into the
source/target type drop-down boxes.  You may type a direct match for an
object into the object class box.  You may also scroll down and pick a
particular entry from the drop-down box.

The "Include Indirect Matches" check box alters the meaning of the
search.  The search finds rules that have either the provided type
or any of the type's attributes in the appropriate field.

Clicking on 'Query Policy' displays a list of all rules fitting your
criteria.  If the policy file you have opened is a source policy, then
this list will contain hyperlinks to take you to the appropriate line
in the policy.conf tab.  Otherwise for a binary policy, hyperlinks
will not be provided.  Double-clicking on a message is another way to
get to the query policy dialog box that is populated with the data.

The second tab, 'policy.conf', provides a convenient display of the
raw policy.conf source file and is only available when opening a
source policy file.

For more extensive policy searches and analysis, use our companion 
policy analysis tool, apol.

Log Views:
----------
The 'Modify View' button opens a dialog box that allows you to modify
a list of filters for the current view of the audit log.  At the top
of the dialog box is a drop-down menu that has four different ways to
apply the list of filters.  You may choose to either show or hide log
entries that match any or all of the filters in the current filter
set.  The View window presents you with the option to add new filters,
edit or remove any defined filters (see Create|Edit Filters below).
You also have the option to save settings for the view to a file.
Additionally, the View window allows you to import/export filters to a
file.

To export a filter click on the name of the desired filter and press
the 'Export' button.  You are now presented with a window where you
can indicate where you want the filter saved, and the name for it to
be saved as.  Once you have selected a destination and name for the
filter click 'OK' button to save the filter to disk.

To import a filter click on the 'Import' button in the filter list
window.  Navigate to the directory where the stored filter is located,
and select it.  Now, click on the 'OK' button to add the saved filter
to your list of filters that were previously available for the current
view.

When you click on the 'Apply' button it will apply the filters for the
associated view.


Create|Edit Filters Within A View: 
----------------------------------
To add a new filter, first select the view for which the filter is
needed by clicking on the corresponding tab.  Then, click on the
'Modify View' button near the top of the main window.  You are now
presented with a View window which contains a list of filters for the
view that was selected.  Now click on the 'Add' button to create a new
filter.  You are now presented with a window in which you can edit the
various properties of a filter such as: its name, description, source
context, target context, object type, etc.

The 'Context' tab allows you to enter values for part or all of the
source and target context, as well as the object class.  Only exact
matches and/or globbed expressions (see Globbing Expressions below)
are accepted for fields on this tab; no regular expressions are
permitted.  You can either enter the values manually with a comma
between entries or click on the button (i.e., Types) and get another
dialog that has a list of all valid entries.  This list can be
populated by values from the log, the policy, or the union of the log
and policy, by selecting the appropriate radio button.

The 'Other' tab allows you to filter by networking criteria (i.e., IP
address, port and/or interface).  The IP addresses require an exact
match or a regular expression; however, Port and Interface are by
exact match only.  You can also filter by executable, path, and/or
hostname from this tab.  These fields accept either an exact match or
a globbed expression (see Globbing Expressions below).

The information that you provide is saved automatically, so you can
just close the window when you are done creating the filter in order
to return to the previous View window.

To edit a previously created filter simply select the filter that
needs to be changed and press the 'Edit' button.  All the information
that had been previously added to the filter is now displayed in a
window where you can edit any of the properties of the filter that
need to be changed. The changes are saved automatically, so you can
just close the window once you are done editing the filter.

Clicking on the 'Clear Values' button at the bottom of either tab
clears the values in the current tab only.


Globbing Expressions:
---------------------
Using globbed expressions allows one to construct more flexible search
filters by allowing for pattern expansion instead of just static
strings.  There are several different methods of globbing syntax that
are supported by SEAudit.

(1) Wildcard Matching

String containing the characters '?' and '*' are said to contain
wildcard characters.  While, both are considered wildcards they allow
for different functionality.

  (a) The '?' character matches any character.

      example: ?at matches the strings aat, bat, cat, etc.

  (b) The '*' matches any string.

      example: sys* matches the strings system, sysadmin, etc.

(2) Character Classes

Character classes are used when one desires to find certain
characters, at a certain position within a string. The '[' character
is used to begin a character class and the ']' character is used to
end the class.  The characters in the string contained between the two
brackets comprise the character class, which can NOT be empty.
	
      example: e[abz]x matches the strings eax, ebx, ezx

(3) Ranges

Ranges are an extension of character classes which allow one to allow
for finding a certain sequential set of characters at any point in the
string.  The '-' character is used to indicate a range of characters,
where the character to the left of the '-' is the beginning and the
character to the right of the '-' is the end.  Multiple ranges can be
used within the same character class.
	
      example: a[b-e]f matches the strings abf, acf, adf, aef
      example: 1[2-36-8]9 matches the strings 129, 139, 169, 179, 189

(4) Complementation

Complementaion allows for searching using the complement of any given
character class or range.  The character '!' must be the first
character after '[' when one desires to use a complementation.  When
using complementations the complement of the string enclosed in the
brackets after the '!' character is used.

      example: a[!b-y]z matches all three-character strings starting
               with a followed by any character not occurring between b
               and y (inclusive), and ending in z

      example: a[!c-ik-y]z matches all three-character string starting
               with a followed by any character not occurring between c
               and i (inclusive) or between k and y (inclusive), and
               ending in z


*** CAUTION ***

The seaudit program intersperses the use of regular expressions versus
globbed expressions.  So for example, the 'Edit Filter' dialog may
allow only regular expressions for certain criteria, whereas for other
criteria, it may only allow exact matches or the use of a globbed
expression.  The 'Query Policy' dialog only allows the use of regular
expressions or an exact match for search criteria, not globbed
expressions.  Additionally, note that all characters used in globbing
expressions are case sensitive.


Status Bar:
-----------
At the bottom of seaudit is a status bar.  In the left corner it
displays the approximate version of the policy you have loaded along
with the policy type (binary or source).  The middle displays the
number of log messages displayed "/" the total number of SE Linux
messages in the audit log.  The next label shows the span of the dates
in the audit log and the right-most label shows the status of the
real-time log monitor.


Creating Reports:
-----------------
The REPORT menu allows you to create report files in HTML or
plain-text format using an entire audit log or an seaudit view.
Selecting the 'Create Report' menu item displays a dialog for making
configurations to the report and then saving the report to a file.
There are two frames, one for specifying the input to the report and
the other for specifying how the report is to be created.

The input frame consists of options for indicating whether to use the
entire audit report or to use the messages displayed in the current
log view as input to the report.  Also, there is an option for
including malformed messages within the report (see the previous 'Log
and Policy Files' heading for what makes up a malformed message in
seaudit).  This option is only enabled when the radio button for using
the entire audit log is selected.

The output frame contains radio buttons for specifying the format of
the report (i.e., HTML or plain-text).  Additionally, an entry box is
provided in this frame for specifying a style sheet to use when
creating an HTML report.  There also is an entry box for specifying the
configuration file to use for creating the report.  If the style sheet
or the configuration file is not specified, seaudit will attempt to
use the appropriate system default files.  If a report configuration
file cannot be located at this point, an error will be generated.  All
settings will be saved when this dialog is destroyed.  The values for
the entry boxes, however, are updated once the user has clicked the
'Create Report' button; otherwise, the default values are maintained.
You may change the default values for the style sheet and configuration
file from the Preferences dialog, which is accessible from the File
menu.

You may configure an seaudit report configuration file to use for
creating reports in seaudit.  This file is used to configure
information that is to be presented in the report.  The seaudit report
feature is dependent upon this file in order to successfully generate
reports.  From this file, one can configure various sections for the
report, as well as create custom sections in the report through the
use of saved seaudit view files.  Review the default
seaudit-report.conf file that comes packaged with your setools
distribution for more information.  This file can be located in the
shared data directory where seaudit was installed, typically
/usr/local/share/setools-<version>.
