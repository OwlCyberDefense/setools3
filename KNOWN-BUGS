CURRENT BUGS AND ISSUES

This file contains a description of the bugs of which we are currently
aware. There are undoubtedly more; please report any new bugs you may
find to setools-bugs@tresys.com.

APOL
   
1. Double clicking on listbox items may not display popup windows in
   certain window managers.  You must right-click on the item in order
   to display popup windows.  This is due to Tk's event buffer and is
   not fixable.  (Ref: http://tinyurl.com/ltmuh)
   
2. The use of some fonts may cause widgets in the GUI to be obscured.
   If you experience this problem, you may edit the fonts in the .apol
   file in your home directory.  Apol is designed to fit on a 1024x768
   display; users will have problems with resolutions less than this.
   
3. Apol will correctly load policies with aliases, but the alias names
   will be lost (the root type name is used instead).  Therefore,
   aliases are not displayed and queries should not use them as
   parameters.

4. Certain older source policies will not load if complemented type 
   sets are used outside of neverallow rules.  This is due to apol using
   a similar parser to checkpolicy, which no longer accepts this use of
   the complement operator (~).

SEAUDIT

1. Sorting by date will not work correctly if your audit log spans 
   through a new calendar year.  For example, if your audit log 
   includes entries from December 2003 and January 2004, when you sort 
   by date January 2004 will come before December 2003 entire.  This 
   is because audit logs do not include a year so we assign the same 
   year to all dates.

2. Sorting in seaudit does not work as intended.  It is being fixed
   for an upcoming version of SETools.
