# Declarations for type attributes.
# 

# A type attribute can be used to identify a set of types with a similar
# property.  Each type can have any number of attributes, and each
# attribute can be associated with any number of types.  Attributes are
# explicitly declared here, and can then be associated with particular
# types in type declarations.  Attribute names can then be used throughout 
# the configuration to express the set of types that are associated with 
# the attribute.  Except for the MLS attributes, attributes have no implicit
# meaning to SELinux.  The meaning of all other attributes are completely 
# defined through their usage within the configuration, but should be 
# documented here as comments preceding the attribute declaration.  

#####################
# Attributes for MLS:
#

# The mlstrustedreader attribute identifies every domain that can
# override the normal MLS restrictions on reading (i.e. domains
# that can read up).  
attribute mlstrustedreader;

# The mlstrustedwriter attribute identifies every domain that can
# override the normal MLS restrictions on writing (i.e. domains
# that can write down).  
attribute mlstrustedwriter;

# The mlstrustedobject attribute identifies every type that can
# be accessed without normal MLS restrictions (i.e. processes can
# read or write objects with this type regardless of MLS level).  
# Examples:  /dev/null, descriptors created by login
attribute mlstrustedobject;


#########################
# Attributes for domains:
#

# The domain attribute identifies every type that can be 
# assigned to a process.  This attribute is used in TE rules 
# that should be applied to all domains, e.g. permitting 
# init to kill all processes or permitting all processes
# to read a particular file.
attribute domain;

# The privuser attribute identifies every domain that can 
# change its SELinux user identity.  This attribute is used 
# in the constraints configuration.  NOTE:  This attribute
# is not required for domains that merely change the Linux
# uid attributes, only for domains that must change the
# SELinux user identity.
attribute privuser;

# The privrole attribute identifies every domain that can 
# change its SELinux role.  This attribute is used in the 
# constraints configuration.
attribute privrole;

# The privowner attribute identifies every domain that can 
# assign a different SELinux user identity to a file.  This 
# attribute is used in the constraints configuration.
attribute privowner;

# The privlog attribute identifies every domain that can 
# communicate with syslogd through its Unix domain socket.
# This attribute is used in the TE rules in 
# domains/program/syslogd.te to grant such access.  
# XXX If you want to mandate the use of this attribute for all 
# XXX domains that can log, then you should also write corresponding 
# XXX assertions in assert.te to enforce this restriction.  Otherwise,
# XXX it is just an optional convenience for domain writers.
attribute privlog;

# The privmem attribute identifies every domain that can 
# access kernel memory devices.
# This attribute is used in the TE assertions to verify
# that such access is limited to domains that are explicitly
# tagged with this attribute.
attribute privmem;

# The privfd attribute identifies every domain that should have
# file handles inherited widely (IE sshd_t and getty_t).
attribute privfd;

# The privhome attribute identifies every domain that can create files under
# regular user home directories in the regular context (IE act on behalf of
# a user in writing regular files)
attribute privhome;

# The auth attribute identifies every domain that needs
# to perform user authentication and requires access to
# the corresponding authentication data.  
# XXX This attribute is no longer in use except in type declarations.
# XXX It was introduced for the original attempt to put /etc/shadow into
# XXX a separate type and to limit read access to certain domains.  
# XXX Doing so transparently to applications is problematic due to
# XXX the fact that both /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow are recreated
# XXX by the same processes and live in the same directory, so file type
# XXX transition rules cannot specify different default types.  Relocating
# XXX /etc/shadow to a separate subdirectory was tried, but required
# XXX modifications to a lot of applications even after changing
# XXX the pwdb shared library.
attribute auth;

# The admin attribute identifies every administrator domain.
# It is used in TE assertions when verifying that only administrator 
# domains have certain permissions.  
# This attribute is presently associated with sysadm_t and 
# certain administrator utility domains.  
# XXX The use of this attribute should be reviewed for consistency.
# XXX Might want to partition into several finer-grained attributes 
# XXX used in different assertions within assert.te.
attribute admin;

# The userdomain attribute identifies every user domain, presently
# user_t and sysadm_t.  It is used in TE rules that should be applied
# to all user domains.
attribute userdomain;

# attribute for all non-administrative devpts types
attribute userpty_type;

# The user_crond_domain attribute identifies every user_crond domain, presently
# user_crond_t and sysadm_crond_t.  It is used in TE rules that should be
# applied to all user domains.
attribute user_crond_domain;

# The unpriv_userdomain identifies non-administrative users (default user_t)
attribute unpriv_userdomain;

# This attribute is for the main user home directory for unpriv users
attribute user_home_dir_type;

# The gphdomain attribute identifies every gnome-pty-helper derived
# domain.  It is used in TE rules to permit inheritance and use of
# descriptors created by these domains.
attribute gphdomain;


############################
# Attributes for file types:
#

# The file_type attribute identifies all types assigned to files 
# in persistent filesystems.  It is used in TE rules to permit
# the association of all such file types with persistent filesystem
# types, and to permit certain domains to access all such types as 
# appropriate.
attribute file_type;

# The sysadmfile attribute identifies all types assigned to files 
# that should be completely accessible to administrators.  It is used
# in TE rules to grant such access for administrator domains.
attribute sysadmfile;

# The fs_type attribute identifies all types assigned to filesystems
# (not limited to persistent filesystems).
# It is used in TE rules to permit certain domains to mount
# any filesystem and to permit most domains to obtain the
# overall filesystem statistics.
attribute fs_type;

# The root_dir_type attribute identifies all types assigned to 
# root directories of filesystems (not limited to persistent
# filesystems).
# XXX This attribute was used to grant mountassociate permission,
# XXX but this permission is no longer defined.  We can likely
# XXX remove this attribute.
attribute root_dir_type;

# The exec_type attribute identifies all types assigned
# to entrypoint executables for domains.  This attribute is 
# used in TE rules and assertions that should be applied to all 
# such executables.
attribute exec_type;

# The tmpfile attribute identifies all types assigned to temporary 
# files.  This attribute is used in TE rules to grant certain 
# domains the ability to remove all such files (e.g. init, crond).
attribute tmpfile;

# The user_tmpfile attribute identifies all types associated with temporary
# files for unpriv_userdomain domains.
attribute user_tmpfile;

# for the user_xserver_tmp_t etc
attribute xserver_tmpfile;

# The tmpfsfile attribute identifies all types defined for tmpfs 
# type transitions. 
# It is used in TE rules to grant certain domains the ability to
# access all such files.
attribute tmpfsfile;

# The home_type attribute identifies all types assigned to home
# directories.  This attribute is used in TE rules to grant certain
# domains the ability to access all home directory types.
attribute home_type;

# This attribute is for the main user home directory /home/user, to
# distinguish it from sub-dirs.  Often you want a process to be able to
# read the user home directory but not read the regular directories under it.
attribute home_dir_type;

# The ttyfile attribute identifies all types assigned to ttys.
# It is used in TE rules to grant certain domains the ability to
# access all ttys.
attribute ttyfile;

# The ptyfile attribute identifies all types assigned to ptys.
# It is used in TE rules to grant certain domains the ability to
# access all ptys.
attribute ptyfile;

# The pidfile attribute identifies all types assigned to pid files.
# It is used in TE rules to grant certain domains the ability to
# access all such files.

# XXX This attribute is unused.  Remove?
attribute socket_type;

# Identifies all types assigned to port numbers to control binding.
attribute port_type;

# Identifies all types assigned to network interfaces to control

#
# if you have several users who run the same run_init type program for
# different purposes (think of a run_db program used by several database

# $1 is the source domain (or domains), $2 is the source role (or roles) and $3
# is the base name for the domain to run.  $1 is normally sysadm_t, and $2 is

# sample usage:
# run_program(sysadm_t, sysadm_r, init, etc_t, initrc_t)
#
# if you have several users who run the same run_init type program for
# different purposes (think of a run_db program used by several database
# administrators to start several databases) then you can list all the source
# domains in $1, all the source roles in $2, but you may not want to list all
# types of programs to run in $4 and target domains in $5 (as that may permit
# entering a domain from the wrong type).  In such a situation just specify
