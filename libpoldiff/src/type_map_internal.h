 *  it.
 *
 *  <li>For all remaining unmapped primary types in the original

 *  <li>For all remaining unmapped primary types in the modified
 *  policy, if that type name appears as an alias to an unmapped
 *  primary in the original then map it.
 *
 *  <li>For all remaining unmapped primary types in both policies, if
 *  all of the aliases of one type are exactly the same as another
 *  type's aliases then map it.
 *
 *  <li>All remaining types are left as unmapped.
