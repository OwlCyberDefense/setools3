./attrib.te:
	1. add login_context attrib; not used in default policy but provided
	to allow tools to grant access to all files associated with initial
	contexts
	
./types/security.te
	1, removed sysadmfile from policy_src_t and policy_config_t; 
	admin_marco.te will provide "temporary" access to policy_src_t as
	an interim measure.
	2. added default_context_t, with sysadmfile and new login_contexts 
	attributes (left sysadmfile since it's reasonable for an administrator
	in default installations to edit these file with an editor).

./domain/programs/login.te
	1. Gave local_login_t and remote_login_t read access to 
	default_context_t

./domains/program/crond.te
	1. add new login_contexts attribute to cron_context
	
./domains/programs/sshd.te
 	1. Gave sshd_t and sshd_login_t read access to default_context_t

./macros/admin_macro.te
	1. As temporary measure to allow sysadm_t the same current 
	ability	to change policy src files, add the following rules
	
	allow $1_t policy_src_t:notdevfile_class_set create_file_perms;
	allow $1_t policy_src_t:dir create_dir_perms; 
	
	2. Removed security_t:security load_policy access from macro;
	only load_policy_t needs this.

./domains/programs/checkpolicy.te (new)
	1. added types checkpolicy_t and checkpolicy_exec_t
	2. added checkpolicy rules

./domains/programs/load_policy.te (new)
	1. added types load_policy_t and load_policy_exec_t
	2. added load_policy rules


changes to filecontexts: 
	1. added checkpolicy.fc (new)
	2. added load_policy.fc (new)
	3. within types.fc, added labels for following:
		/etc/security/selinux/src/
		/etc/security/default_context

./Makefile
	0. Did nothing with initrd stuff!
	1. Fixed policy.conf target to make tmp a dependent target.
	2. Install target invokes checkpolicy directly, and puts 
	the results in the install dir (without gzip).
	3. New install-src target added to install policy source
	directory
	
Needed: 
1. A new system installation procedure is probably needed to include 
make install-src on initial system build.

2. zlib library built into checkpolicy

3. -o -g -m options in checkpolicy?
