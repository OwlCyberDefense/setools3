CURRENT BUGS AND ISSUES

This file contains a description of the bugs of which we are currently 
aware. There are undoubtedly more; please report any new bugs you may 
find to selinux@tresys.com.

APOL
   
1. There is a bug in the text search feature. The text widgets' 
   search command does not handle a '-' as the first character in the 
   string. 
   
2. The domain transition analysis currently does not handle the '~' 
   semantics in allow rules
   
3. Double clicking on listbox items may not display popup windows in 
   certain window managers, such as Gnome or Ximian. For example, 
   double-clicking an attribute in the [policy components]/types tab 
   does not display the types for that attribute. You must right-
   click on the item in order to display popup windows. This is a 
   Tcl/Tk bug and has been submitted to 
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcllib.
   
4. The use of some fonts may cause widgets in the GUI to be obscured. 
   If you experience this problem, you may edit the fonts in the 
   .apol file in your home directory. Apol may also obscure widgets  
   from the screen on resolutions less than 1024x768.
   
5. Apol will correctly load policies with aliases, but the alias 
   names will be lost (the root type name is used instead). 
   Therefore, aliases are not displayed and queries cannot use them 
   as parameters.
   
6. Searching for specific permissions in AV rules will return 
   rules that have '*' even if the listed object classes do not 
   have the requested permissions.

SEPCUT

1. There is a bug in the text search feature. The text widgets' search 
   command does not handle a '-' as the first character in the string. 


LIBAPOL

1. Lots of yacc shift/reduce errors in libapol that don't currently 
   impact operation (so it appears).
   
2. Complements are not always correctly handled in type and 
   permission lists.

3. The direct file relabel analysis does not currently 
   distinguish object classes, resulting in some false positives. 
   This should not effect most well-written policies.

SEAUDIT

1. Sorting by date will not work correctly if your audit log spans 
   through a new calendar year.  For example, if your audit log 
   includes entries from December 2003 and January 2004, when you sort 
   by date January 2004 will come before December 2003 entire.  This 
   is because audit logs do not include a year so we assign the same 
   year to all dates.
