=======================================================
February 16, 2005, Version 2.0

setools:
	
libsefs:
	Converted to use an on-disk SQLite database backend and 
	  re-designed API to provide the functionality to other 
	  applications, such as apol.
libapol:
	Added support for analyzing direct file relabels.
	Added support for analyzing relationship between two types.
	Integrated use of hashtable structures for easily analyzing
	  differences between policies.
	Minor bug fixes.
	
libseuser:
	Minor bug fixes.
	
apol:
	New analysis module for performing direct file relabel
	  analysis.
	New analysis module for analyzing the relationship be-
	  tween two types.

sediff:
	New gtk GUI and command-line tools for analyzing the semantic
