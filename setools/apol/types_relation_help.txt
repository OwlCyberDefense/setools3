UNDERSTANDING TYPES RELATIONSHIP SUMMARY ANALYSIS

The types relationship summary analysis in Apol is a convenience
mechanism to allow a user to quickly do several queries and
analyses already in present in Apol to understand the
relationship between two types. This is meant to quickly display
the relationship between two types and therefore doesn't include
all of the options present in the standard queries and analyses.
The analyses are grouped into two categories: Basic and Analysis.

BASIC

The basic group includes several rule searches that can be
performed using the Policy Rules tab.

Common Attributes: the attributes common to both types.

Common Roles: the roles to which both types are assigned.

Common Users: the users allowed associate with roles to which 
both types are assigned.

Common Access to Resources: object types to which both types have
some access.

Dissimilar Access to Resources: object types to which one type
has some access but the other type has none.

TE Allow Rules: rules that provide direct access between both
types.

Type Transition / Change Rules: type_* rules that allow
transitions between both types.

ANALYSIS

The analysis group includes several other analyses that can be 
performed using the Analysis tab.

Direct Flows Between A and B: direct information flow analysis
between the two types.

Transitive Flows A->B: transitive information flows from type A
to B.

Transitive Flows B->A: transitive information flows from type B
to A.

Domain Transitions A->B: domain transitions allowed from type A
to B.

Domain Transitions B->A: domain transitions allowed from type B
to A.
