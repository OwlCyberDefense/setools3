Overview:
========
Sediff is a policy analysis tool that parses two given policy files and compares them showing a list of the differences. It can compare source and/or binary policies. It can also compare different versions of policy. For source policies, versions 12 and high of SELinux policies are supported. For binary policies, versions 15 and higher are supported.

Limitations:
===========
Sediff currently compares only the following policy elements:
        + object classes and permissions
        + types and attributes
        + roles
        + users
        + booleans
        + type enforcement rules (allow, type_transitions)
        + role allow rules
        + role transition rules
        + conditionals
        
Other elements will be added as the core libraries support them.

What is a Semantic Diff?
========================
The challenge with comparing two policies is that a straightforward textual comparison is of little value. What one needs is the ability to determine semantically how to policies differ. For example, one could not simply grep for allow rules with a given type, and then compare them to a similar list from another policy. Many factors effect the semantic meaning of the rules. For example, multiple rules can allow differing sets of permissions. Attributes can allow permission to/from a type.

What sediff does, is analyze each policy semantically. In this way, it resolves any conflicts and determines whether there is a substantial differences. This approach also allows binary and source policies to be compared, as well as different versions of policies.

NOTE: The one semantic assumption sediff makes is that when an identifier (e.g., a type name) has the same string value in each policy, then it represents the same semantic meaning in both policy.

Sediff commands:
===============
Sediff can be run from command line or as a GUI. For command line help, run "sediff --help". To start the GUI (the primary focus of this help file), either of the following commands will work:
        sediff -X [policy1 policy2]
        sediffx [policy1 policy2]


Understanding Sediff's Results: 
==============================
After differing two policies, the GUI shows the policy areas compared in the left hand frame. Besides each policy area is a number representing the total number of differences in that area. As a general rule, for each policy area, the righthand window shows the detailed results. 

NOTE: All differences are shown from the perspective of the first policy given (i.e., policy 1).  There are three types of differences shown:

        + Added (+): A policy component was added by policy 2 (in policy 2 but not policy 1)
        + Removed (-): A policy component was removed by policy 2 (in policy 1 but not policy 2)
        + Changed (*): A policy component was present in both policies, but somehow changed by policy 2.
        

Supported Policy Areas Differences:
==================================
Below is an explanation of the difference for each supported policy area:

   Classes:
   -------
   Classes can be added, removed, or changed. Changed means that the permissions associated with the classes have changed between the two policies.
        
   Permissions:
   -----------
   Permissions can either be added or removed, they cannot be changed.

   Common Permissions:
   -------------------
   Common permissions are compared much like classes. They can be added, removed or changed, where change means that the permissions associated with the common permission has changed.
        
   Types:
   -----
   Types can be added, removed, or changed. Change means that the attributes associated with a type are different between the two policies. Attributes can be added or removed from a type.

   Attributes:
   -----------
   Attributes can be added, removed, changed because a type added in policy 2 was associated with the attribute, changed because a type removed in policy 2 is not associated with the attribute, and changed because a type that exists in both policies was added or removed.    

   Roles:
   -----
   Roles can be added, removed, changed because a type added in policy 2 is added the role, changed because a type removed in policy 2 is removed from the role, and changed because a type that exists in both policies was added or removed.    
   
   Users: 
   ------
   Users can be added, removed, or changed. Changed means that the roles associated with a user are different between the two policies. Roles can be added or removed from a user.
  
   Booleans:
   --------
   Booleans can be added, removed, or changed. If you compare a version 15 or earlier policy with a version 16 or later policy. All the booleans will be added/removed (booleans came in version 16). Change means that the default value is different between the two policies.

   Role Allow Rules:
   ----------------
   Role allow rules determine if a role is allowed to transition (either explicitly or through a role_transition) to another. Diffing a role allow involves taking the source role and checking to see if there are corresponding rules in the other policy. If there is no rule with this source in the first policy it is an add, likewise if there is none in the second policy it is a remove. If role allows with the same source exist in both policies then the target roles are shown as a change.

   Role Transition Rules:
   ---------------------
   Role transition rules are rules that determine what role to transition to when that role acts on a type.  Diffing a role transition rule involves taking the source role and the type, checking to see if this pair exists in the other policy and if it does to see if the target role is the same in both policies. Role transitions can be added and contains only types that exist in both policies, added and contains a type that is new in policy 2, removed and contains only types that exist in both policies, removed and contains a type that is missing in policy 2, and changed.

   TE Rules: 
   ---------
   The TE rules areas covers the "meat" of a policy. This area includes AV rules (allow, audit_allow, and dont_audit) and Type rules (type_transitions and type_change). The rule comparison is truly semantic. All issues of redundancy and duplication, as well as indirect access through attributes are resolved. All rules are keyed by the "source-target-class" (STC) triple.  In addition, conditional rules are distinguished from non-conditional rules. Thus, for example, two rules with the same STC will not be compared if one is non-conditional and the other is conditional, or if both are conditional but conditioned on two different conditional expressions. For conditional rules, the conditional expression is compared to ensure that conditional rules are meaningfully compared. In the results pane, conditional rules are indicated by a "T" or "F" (representing the TRUE or FALSE list of a conditional expressions), as well as a rendering of its associated conditional expression.
   
   NOTE: For conditional rules, the default and current values of the booleans are ignored. Conditional expressions are compared as if the booleans are all the same.
   
   Rules can be added, added because the rule contains a type added in policy 2, removed, removed because the rule contains a type that was removed in policy 2, or changed. Added means the STC triple for that rule is not present in Policy 1, but is in Policy 2. Removed means the STC triple is present in Policy 1, but not in Policy 2. For AV rules, change means that the permissions for the rule are different between the policies. For Type rules, change means that the default type is different between the policies.
   
   When source policies are compared, hyper-linked line numbers are shown that take you to the source ".conf" file where the rule is defined. If there are more than one source rules that contribute to a STC triple for a given rule, then all source rules are linked.
      
   Conditional Expressions:
   -----------------------
   While conditional expressions are compared when analyzing conditional TE rules as described above, sediff does not currently support comparing conditional expressions directly.


Policy Tabs:
===========
        Each policy has a tab on the main window labeled Policy #: followed by the policy file name. Under each of these tabs are a policy statistics tab, and a source tab.

    Policy Statistics Tab:
    ----------------------
        The policy statistics tab displays the statistics of that policy.
    
    Source Tab:
    -----------
        If the policy is a source policy, this tab displays the source of that policy.
