#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   SWIG_PYTHON([use-shadow-classes = {no, yes}])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Checks for Python and provides the $(SWIG_PYTHON_CPPFLAGS), and
#   $(SWIG_PYTHON_OPT) output variables.
#
#   $(SWIG_PYTHON_OPT) contains all necessary SWIG options to generate
#   code for Python. Shadow classes are enabled unless the value of the
#   optional first argument is exactly 'no'. If you need multi module
#   support (provided by the SWIG_MULTI_MODULE_SUPPORT macro) use
#   $(SWIG_PYTHON_LIBS) to link against the appropriate library. It
#   contains the SWIG Python runtime library that is needed by the type
#   check system for example.
