#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AC_PROG_JAVA
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Here is a summary of the main macros:
#
#   AC_PROG_JAVAC: finds a Java compiler.
#
#   AC_PROG_JAVA: finds a Java virtual machine.
#
#   AC_CHECK_CLASS: finds if we have the given class (beware of
#   CLASSPATH!).
#
#   AC_CHECK_RQRD_CLASS: finds if we have the given class and stops
#   otherwise.
#
#   AC_TRY_COMPILE_JAVA: attempt to compile user given source.
#
#   AC_TRY_RUN_JAVA: attempt to compile and run user given source.
#
#   AC_JAVA_OPTIONS: adds Java configure options.
#
#   AC_PROG_JAVA tests an existing Java virtual machine. It uses the
#   environment variable JAVA then tests in sequence various common
#   Java virtual machines. For political reasons, it starts with the
#   free ones. You *must* call [AC_PROG_JAVAC] before.
#
#   If you want to force a specific VM:
#
#   - at the configure.in level, set JAVA=yourvm before calling
#   AC_PROG_JAVA
#
#     (but after AC_INIT)
#
#   - at the configure level, setenv JAVA
#
#   You can use the JAVA variable in your Makefile.in, with @JAVA@.
#
#   *Warning*: its success or failure can depend on a proper setting of
#   the CLASSPATH env. variable.
#
#   TODO: allow to exclude virtual machines (rationale: most Java
#   programs cannot run with some VM like kaffe).
#
#   Note: This is part of the set of autoconf M4 macros for Java
#   programs. It is VERY IMPORTANT that you download the whole set,
#   some macros depend on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive
#   does not support the concept of set of macros, so I had to break it
#   for submission.
#
#   A Web page, with a link to the latest CVS snapshot is at
#   <http://www.internatif.org/bortzmeyer/autoconf-Java/>.
#
#   This is a sample configure.in Process this file with autoconf to
#   produce a configure script.
#
#      AC_INIT(UnTag.java)
#
#      dnl Checks for programs.
#      AC_CHECK_CLASSPATH
#      AC_PROG_JAVAC
#      AC_PROG_JAVA
#
#      dnl Checks for classes
#      AC_CHECK_RQRD_CLASS(org.xml.sax.Parser)
#      AC_CHECK_RQRD_CLASS(com.jclark.xml.sax.Driver)
#
#      AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)
