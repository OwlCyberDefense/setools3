	* Added qpol_policy_has_capability() to qpol/policy_query.h
	This function and the enumeration qpol_capability_e allows
	a user of the library to check if a loaded policy is 
	capable of supporting various policy features.

	* Support has been added to libqpol for loading policy modules.
	See qpol/policy.h for details.

	* apol_permmap_t is now a hidden declaration.

	been publicly visible.)

	* apol_policy_t is now an opaque structure.  Added accessors such
	as apol_policy_get_qpol() to retrieve some of those fields.  This
	also means that the apol callback function changed, so as to be
	similar to qpol's callback.
