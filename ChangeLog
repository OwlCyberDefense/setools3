2007-05-14  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* correctly marked libqpol defines for genfscon object classes
	  and fs_use behaviors as unsigned constants.

2007-05-14  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* libapol/src/role-query.c (apol_role_get_by_query),
	libapol/src/user-query.c (apol_user_get_by_query): Extra logic
	added when "object_r" is given as the role.  For user queries, all
	users implicitly have object_r assigned to them.  For role
	queries, all types are assigned to object_r.

	* libapol/swig/apol.i: apol_context_validate() and
	apol_context_validate_partial() are now member functions of class
	apol_context_t, rather than being a library function.

	* libapol/include/mls-query.h (apol_mls_cat_name_compare): Removed
	apol_mls_cat_name_compare() from the libapol public API.  This
	function should never have been made public.

	* libapol/src/context-query.c: Fixed potential segfaults in
	modifiers to apol_context_t object, if the same pointer returned
	by its accessor is then passed back in the modifier modifier.

	* libapol/src/context-query.c (apol_context_render): When
	rendering a partial context, unset fields are now explicitly
	represented by an asterisk, rather than by an empty string.

2007-05-11  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* removed usage of typedef'ed bool_t and replaced with bool as 
	  defined by stdbool.h; also replaced defined TRUE and FALSE
	  with true and false constants as defined by stdbool.h.

2007-05-11  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Fix potential segfaults in apol_mls_range functions if the high
	level is not set.

	* Added apol_mls_level_validate() to SWIG wrappers.  Added
	apol_mls_range_get_low() and apol_mls_range_get_high().
	apol_mls_range_validate() is now a member function of class
	apol_mls_range_t, rather than a library function.

	* Within the SWIG wrappers, apol_mls_level_get_cats() returns a
	vector.  This should have been a string vector instead.

	* Added function apol_mls_level_validate().

2007-05-10  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added setools-libs-tcl target to setools.spec.

	* Removed apol/apol.c; apol is now just a Tcl script that is
	executed by tclsh, rather than a custom compiled Tcl interpreter.

	* Removed the deprecated header apol/avl-util.h and its associated
	source file.

2007-05-08  M. Goldman  <mgoldman@tresys.com>
	* Added next and previous buttons to seaudit

	* Added apol_bst_inorder_map()

2007-05-07  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Changed apol_ipv4_addr_render so that it now takes an array
	  of uint32_t's instead of a single uint32_t.

	* Changed SWIG wrapping for apol_perm_query_t::run() to return
	  apol_string_vector_t instead of apol_vector_t.

	* Added exported pointers to SWIG wrappers of each library
	  to allow changing of the message handler callback and its
	  void * argument.

	* qpol_policy_rebuild() no longer requires a modular policy;
	  it can safely be called for any type of policy.

2007-05-04  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Fixed qpol_module function names in the libqpol SWIG wrappers.

2007-05-04  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Added SWIG wrappers for tcl to libpoldiff and libseaudit.

2007-05-02  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Versioned symbols in other libraries.

2007-05-01  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Versioned symbols in libqpol to allow conditional expansion
	  of neverallow rules from qpol_policy_open_from_*.

2007-05-01  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added apol_avrule_query_set_all_perms().  This changes the
	behavior when matching multiple permissions.

2007-04-30  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added --enable-swig-tcl flag to configure script.

2007-04-25  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Official release of SETools-3.2.

2007-04-20  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added seaudit_log_parse_buffer(), needed because
	seaudit_log_parse() is not possible with the Java SWIG library.

	* Build system updated to suppress warnings from automake
	1.10, and for parallel compilation (i.e., make -j).

2007-04-18  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* The function apol_domain_trans_result_create_from_domain_trans_result()
	  is now publicly exported. Also added is apol_domain_trans_result_destroy()
	  to free memory used by duplicated results.

2007-04-17  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Fixed potential segfault in seaudit_filter_set_date() when
	called using the same struct tm pointers that were returned by
	seaudit_filter_get_date().  The old code would dereference
	memory that was just free()d.

2007-04-16  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* apol_mls_range_get_levels() fixed so that its returned levels
	only include categories that are valid for the given policy.
	Before it just copied the categories for the high level, even if a
	lower level could not actually have one of those categories.

	* apol_mls_level_get_cats() now always returns categories in
	alphabetical order.

2007-04-06  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added seaudit_avc_message_get_name() and
	seaudit_sort_by_name().  seaudit now shows AVC messages' name
	field; this column may be be hidden through the updated
	preferences dialog.

	* Updated libqpol to use libsepol >= 2.0.0 if available.
	configure should be able to autodetect this.

2007-04-05  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* sediffx now allows the user to select which components to diff,
	rather than always diffing everything.

	* fix to domain transition analysis, where setexec rules might not
	be found correctly given certain policies.

2007-04-04  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* New configure option --enable-swig-java to enable build of Java
	SWIG wrappers.

2007-04-03  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Added apol_file_is_policy_path_list() to validate policy path
	  list files.

	* Added ability to specify policy path list files from command
	  line for all tools taking a policy as an argument.

2007-04-02  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Removed the "all_files" symbol from libsefs; this symbol was
	  previously marked as deprecated.

2007-03-29  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Libpoldiff SWIG wrapper added; wrapper treats all structures as
	  classes in the target language.

2007-03-28  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Introduced 'policy list' in apol, seaudit, and sediffx.  This is
	a small text file that contains references to a base policy and
	any number of modules.

2007-03-27  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added apol_policy_path_create_from_file() and
	apol_policy_path_to_file().

	* apol_str_trim() no longer has a return value; it also operates
	directly on a string, rather than a reference to a string.

	* apol_vector_t and apol_bst_t now require a destructor function
	to be given during creation time, rather than being passed as a
	second parameter respectively to apol_vector_destroy() and
	apol_bst_destroy().  All of SETools has been updated to this
	scheme.

2007-03-26  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* apol_context_t is now an opaque structure.  Accessors added to
	the user, role, type, and range fields.

2007-03-23  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added apol_mls_level_get_sens() and apol_mls_level_get_cats().

2007-03-23  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Libseaudit SWIG wrapper added; wrapper treats all structures as
	  classes in the target language.

2007-03-23  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* apol_mls_level_t and apol_mls_range_t are now opaque structures.

	* fixed error in seaudit_model_create_from_model(), where the
	duplicate's filters and sorts were being linked to the original
	model, not the newly created one.

	* fixed potential segfault in seaudit_filter_set_name() and
	seaudit_filter_set_description() if the passed in pointer was the
	same one obtained by the respecitve accessor function.

2007-03-22  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Libapol SWIG wrapper updated to treat all structures as classes
	  in the target language.

2007-03-21  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added ability for user to specify type joins and splits in
	sediffx.  The libpoldiff library had always supported this
	feature; it just was not available through the user interface.

2007-03-20  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Renamed apol_domain_trans_table_destroy to domain_trans_table_destroy
	  and moved to policy-query-internal.h; this function was not intended
	  for external use.

2007-03-19  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* When viewing AV rule differences, click (either left or right) a
	permission name.  This will now popup a menu that gives line
	numbers for rules that contributed just that permission, rather
	than the entire AV rule.  This is enabled when source policies are
	used.

2007-03-16  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added poldiff_avrule_get_orig_line_numbers_for_perm() and
	poldiff_avrule_get_mod_line_numbers_for_perm().

2007-03-15  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Split libpoldiff/include/rule_diff.h into
	libpoldiff/include/avrule_diff.h and
	libpoldiff/include/terule_diff.h.  None of the function names were
	changed.

	* Re-standardized all programs' command line options.  -V always
	shows the version, -c always deals with object classes, and so
	forth.  Man pages updated.

	* Renamed libapol/include/rangetrans-query.h to
	libapol/include/range_trans-query.h.  Likewise renamed
	libpoldiff's rangetrans_diff.h  None of the function names were
	changed.

2007-03-13  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* fixed segfault in libseaudit when, while parsing an AVC
	message's permissions list it does not encounter a closing brace.

	* information flow graphs are now being constructed via a BST and
	its O(log n), rather than via a vector and O(n).  It should be
	noticeably faster now.

	* fixed error in information flow analysis, transitive mode.  The
	returned flows were mistakenly all set to be the same object
	class.  For example if a step was foo_t -> bar_t by way of class
	baz_c, subsequent flows were accidentally being constrained to
	also be of baz_c.

	* fixed error in apol_bst_insert() and apol_bst_insert_and_get(),
	where the return values of 0 and 1 were flipped.  The comment was
	correct, but the code was not.

2007-03-12  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* fixed share libraries's soname, such that SETools's programs
	depend upon the correct name.  For example, seaudit's .dynamic
	section should have as a dependency on libseaudit.so.4, not
	libseaudit.so.4.1.

	* sediffx now diffs and displays range transitions

	* sediff -E now diffs range transitions

	* range transition diff added libpoldiff

2007-03-08  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* poldiff_user_get_added_roles() and
	poldiff_user_get_removed_roles() now return all roles when the
	form is POLDIFF_FORM_ADDED / POLDIFF_FORM_REMOVED.

	* sediffx updated to show users' MLS differences

2007-03-07  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* in libpoldiff, if either policy is MLS then when diffing users,
	those users' default MLS level and assigned ranges are also
	diffed.

	* added poldiff_range_t object

	* fixed segfault in libqpol when loading an invalid source policy

	* error messages were not being shown correctly in apol's open
	policy dialog; fixed.

2007-03-06  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* added SWIG wrapper for libqpol. The wrapper treats all libqpol
	structs as classes in the target language.

2007-03-06  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* apol_mls_level_create() will now always return an allocated (and
	empty) category vector as part of the level.  Before it would
	initialize the field as NULL.

	* poldiff_avrule_get_unmodified_perms() no longer returns all
	permissions whenever a rule is added or removed; it only returns
	permissions when the form is POLDIFF_FORM_MODIFIED.  The new
	behavior matches the other policy components.

2007-03-05  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added apol_mls_level_free() and apol_mls_range_get_levels()

2007-03-02  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* qpol_user_get_range() and qpol_user_get_dfltlevel() now return
	NULL if the policy is not MLS.  (It used to return a garbage
	pointer.)

2007-03-01  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added additional accessors to the seaudit_avc_message_t object.

2007-02-28  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added apol_mls_level_create_from_mls_level() and
	apol_mls_range_create_from_mls_range() copy constructors.

	* Fixed segfault when libseaudit attempts to parse certain load
	policy messages.

2007-02-23  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Implemented new sediffx results design.  Results are implemented
	as subclasses of an abstract result_item_t class.  This will allow
	easier future modifications of the sediffx interface.

2007-02-21  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* fixed segfault when opening a policy with
	APOL_POLICY_OPTION_NO_RULES when the policy has an unconditional
	type_transition rule.

2007-02-16  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Moved libqpol/include/qpol/expand.h to libqpol/src/expand.h.
	This header file was never supposed to be visible.

	* added SWIG wrappers to libapol; build system updated.  configure
	must be passed --enable-swig-python to build the wrappers.

2007-02-14  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* sesearch and apol now allow searching range transitions based
	upon the target class.  (Target classes were introduced in version
	21 policies.)

	* added to apol_range_trans_query_append_class() to
	libapol/include/apol/rangetrans-query.h

2007-02-07  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* split --audit flag in sesearch to --auditallow and --dontaudit;
	  the --audit flag is now deprecated.

2007-02-06  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Official release of SETools-3.1.

	* Compile fixes for 64-bit Linux.

2007-02-02  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added RPM spec files.

2007-01-30  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* fixed error in apol when right-clicking an attribute when a file
	contexts database is loaded.

	* fixed error in SQLite configuration in which a pointer size was
	defined as the size of an integer.  this is a no longer valid
	assumption on 64-bit architectures.

	* if apol has a modular policy loaded, then its "policy version"
	for purposes of permission maps is now set to the maximum policy
	version as defined in libsepol.  this mimics the linking behavior
	of sepol.

2007-01-25  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* fixed error where aliases within modules were not being detected
	properly

2007-01-19  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* all files now have correct copyright and license notices

2007-01-19  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* updated all help documentation

2007-01-17  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* updated all man pages

2007-01-17  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added poldiff_type_remap_entry_get_is_inferred()

	* sediffx converted to use modular policies.

2007-01-08  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* apol converted to use modular policies.

2007-01-05  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Added capability QPOL_CAP_SOURCE to detect ability to display
	  the policy source.

	* Deprecated qpol_policy_is_mls_enabled() use
	  qpol_policy_has_capability() for QPOL_CAP_MLS instead.

2007-01-04  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* seaudit converted to use modular policies.

2007-01-03  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Deprecated apol_policy_open() and apol_policy_open_no_rules();
	use apol_policy_create_from_policy_path() instead.

2006-12-14  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added apol_policy_path_t object.  This is needed because policy
	paths are not just a single string, but rather a base policy and
	any number of modules.

	* New functions apol_config_join_var() generalized to be
	apol_str_join().  Same with apol_config_split_var() ->
	apol_str_split().

2006-12-12  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Renamed qpol_find_default_policy_file() in qpol/policy.h to
	qpol_default_policy_find() in qpol/util.h.  Removed
	qpol_find_default_policy_file_strerr().  These functions were
	never supposed to be in these locations.

	* Deprecated apol_policy_is_binary(); use qpol policy capabilities
	instead.

	* Deprecated qpol_open_policy_from_file(); it is now called
	qpol_policy_open_from_file().  Similar change to
	qpol_open_policy_from_file_no_rules() and
	qpol_open_policy_from_memory().

	* Merged qpol/policy_query.h into qpol/policy.h.  Split module
	related code into qpol/module.h.

	* Rewrite of seaudit to utilize libseaudit.so.4; tweaked numerous
	interface issues.

	* Rewrite of libseaudit to meet coding standards.  libseaudit.so.4
	is now a shared object file with proper namespacing.

2006-12-11  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Added qpol_policy_has_capability() to qpol/policy_query.h
	This function and the enumeration qpol_capability_e allows
	a user of the library to check if a loaded policy is
	capable of supporting various policy features.

	* Support has been added to libqpol for loading policy modules.
	See qpol/policy.h for details.

2006-12-01  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* deprecated apol_config_get_varlist() and
	apol_config_varlist_to_str(); added apol_file_find_path(),
	apol_config_split_var(), and apol_config_join_var()

2006-12-01  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Official release of SETools 3.0.1.

2006-11-29  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* synced source parser to libsepol 1.15.2.

2006-11-27  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added application icons to apol, seaudit, and sediffx

2006-11-09  j. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* added __cplusplus guards to all external headers

2006-11-08  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* apol_permmap_t is now a hidden declaration.
	apol_permmap_destroy() has been removed.  (It should never have
	been publicly visible.)

	* apol_policy_t is now an opaque structure.  Added accessors such
	as apol_policy_get_qpol() to retrieve some of those fields.  This
	also means that the apol callback function changed, so as to be
	similar to qpol's callback.

2006-11-07  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* renamed apol_get_*_by_query() to apol_*_get_by_query to match
	  naming conventions of other functions. Old versions were retained and
	  marked as deprecated.

2006-11-02  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added apol_str_strdup() (declared in apol/util.h)

	* apol_vector_create_from_vector() takes two additional arguments,
	so that it can act more like a copy constructor.


2006-11-01  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* added ability for avrule and terule queries to search to only types or
	  only attributes for both source and target fields (separate option for
	  each field, default is to search both types and attributes).

	* added apol_get_syn_avrule_by_query() and apol_get_syn_terule_by_query()

2006-10-27  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added apol_str_appendf() (declared in apol/util.h)

2006-10-27  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* added make indent to standardize code indentation style

	* indented all .c and .h files with make indent (except sqlite which it skips)

2006-10-25  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* seaudit-report Logwatch script will look for
	$(bindir)/seaudit-report, rather than the hard-coded
	/usr/bin/seaudit-report

2006-10-25 J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* numbered steps for loading

	* loading syntactic rule table is now off by default

	* updated tools requiring line numbers to build syntactic table as needed

2006-10-24  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* exclude the sqlite files from the Doxygen configuration

2006-10-19  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added lib<foo>_get_version() functions to libqpol, libpoldiff,
	and libsefs

2006-10-17  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* seaudit-report binary was mistakenly called "seaudit_report"

	* Updated man pages to match programs' help files.

2006-10-13  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Official release of SETools 3.0.
