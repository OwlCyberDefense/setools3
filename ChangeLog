2007-02-05  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Official release of SETools-3.1.

2007-02-02  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added RPM spec files.

2007-01-30  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* fixed error in apol when right-clicking an attribute when a file
	contexts database is loaded.

	* fixed error in SQLite configuration in which a pointer size was
	defined as the size of an integer.  this is a no longer valid
	assumption on 64-bit architectures.

	* if apol has a modular policy loaded, then its "policy version"
	for purposes of permission maps is now set to the maximum policy
	version as defined in libsepol.  this mimics the linking behavior
	of sepol.

2007-01-25  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* fixed error where aliases within modules were not being detected
	properly

2007-01-19  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* all files now have correct copyright and license notices

2007-01-19  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* updated all help documentation

2007-01-17  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* updated all man pages

2007-01-17  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added poldiff_type_remap_entry_get_is_inferred()

	* sediffx converted to use modular policies.

2007-01-08  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* apol converted to use modular policies.

2007-01-05  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Added capability QPOL_CAP_SOURCE to detect ability to display
	  the policy source.

	* Deprecated qpol_policy_is_mls_enabled() use
	  qpol_policy_has_capability() for QPOL_CAP_MLS instead.

2007-01-04  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* seaudit converted to use modular policies.

2007-01-03  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Deprecated apol_policy_open() and apol_policy_open_no_rules();
	use apol_policy_create_from_policy_path() instead.

2006-12-14  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added apol_policy_path_t object.  This is needed because policy
	paths are not just a single string, but rather a base policy and
	any number of modules.

	* New functions apol_config_join_var() generalized to be
	apol_str_join().  Same with apol_config_split_var() ->
	apol_str_split().

2006-12-12  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Renamed qpol_find_default_policy_file() in qpol/policy.h to
	qpol_default_policy_find() in qpol/util.h.  Removed
	qpol_find_default_policy_file_strerr().  These functions were
	never supposed to be in these locations.

	* Deprecated apol_policy_is_binary(); use qpol policy capabilities
	instead.

	* Deprecated qpol_open_policy_from_file(); it is now called
	qpol_policy_open_from_file().  Similar change to
	qpol_open_policy_from_file_no_rules() and
	qpol_open_policy_from_memory().

	* Merged qpol/policy_query.h into qpol/policy.h.  Split module
	related code into qpol/module.h.

	* Rewrite of seaudit to utilize libseaudit.so.4; tweaked numerous
	interface issues.

	* Rewrite of libseaudit to meet coding standards.  libseaudit.so.4
	is now a shared object file with proper namespacing.

2006-12-11  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Added qpol_policy_has_capability() to qpol/policy_query.h
	This function and the enumeration qpol_capability_e allows
	a user of the library to check if a loaded policy is
	capable of supporting various policy features.

	* Support has been added to libqpol for loading policy modules.
	See qpol/policy.h for details.

2006-12-01  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* deprecated apol_config_get_varlist() and
	apol_config_varlist_to_str(); added apol_file_find_path(),
	apol_config_split_var(), and apol_config_join_var()

2006-12-01  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Official release of SETools 3.0.1.

2006-11-29  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* synced source parser to libsepol 1.15.2.

2006-11-27  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added application icons to apol, seaudit, and sediffx

2006-11-09  j. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* added __cplusplus guards to all external headers

2006-11-08  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* apol_permmap_t is now a hidden declaration.
	apol_permmap_destroy() has been removed.  (It should never have
	been publicly visible.)

	* apol_policy_t is now an opaque structure.  Added accessors such
	as apol_policy_get_qpol() to retrieve some of those fields.  This
	also means that the apol callback function changed, so as to be
	similar to qpol's callback.

2006-11-07  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* renamed apol_get_*_by_query() to apol_*_get_by_query to match
	  naming conventions of other functions. Old versions were retained and
	  marked as deprecated.

2006-11-02  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added apol_str_strdup() (declared in apol/util.h)

	* apol_vector_create_from_vector() takes two additional arguments,
	so that it can act more like a copy constructor.


2006-11-01  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* added ability for avrule and terule queries to search to only types or
	  only attributes for both source and target fields (separate option for
	  each field, default is to search both types and attributes).

	* added apol_get_syn_avrule_by_query() and apol_get_syn_terule_by_query()

2006-10-27  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added apol_str_appendf() (declared in apol/util.h)

2006-10-27  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* added make indent to standardize code indentation style

	* indented all .c and .h files with make indent (except sqlite which it skips)

2006-10-25  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* seaudit-report Logwatch script will look for
	$(bindir)/seaudit-report, rather than the hard-coded
	/usr/bin/seaudit-report

2006-10-25 J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* numbered steps for loading

	* loading syntactic rule table is now off by default

	* updated tools requiring line numbers to build syntactic table as needed

2006-10-24  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* exclude the sqlite files from the Doxygen configuration

2006-10-19  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added lib<foo>_get_version() functions to libqpol, libpoldiff,
	and libsefs

2006-10-17  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* seaudit-report binary was mistakenly called "seaudit_report"

	* Updated man pages to match programs' help files.
