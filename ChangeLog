	* apol_permmap_t is now a hidden declaration.
	apol_permmap_destroy() has been removed.  (It should never have
	been publicly visible.)

	* apol_policy_t is now an opaque structure.  Added accessors such
	as apol_policy_get_qpol() to retrieve some of those fields.  This
	also means that the apol callback function changed, so as to be
	similar to qpol's callback.

	* renamed apol_get_*_by_query() to apol_*_get_by_query to match

	  only attributes for both source and target fields (separate option for
