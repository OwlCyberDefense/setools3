	  clear that it is Tk, not an SETools library that connot be loaded.

2010-03-01  John Oliver <joliver@tresys.com>

	* Fix error in Apol which would disable new and updated search
	  buttons in rule search.

2009-12-09  John Oliver <joliver@tresys.com>

	* Fix seaudit-report to correctly handle -c and --config
	  options.

2009-07-22  Chris PeBenito <cpebenito@tresys.com>

	* SETools 3.3.6.

2009-07-16  Chris PeBenito <cpebenito@tresys.com>

	* Change default log for seaudit to /var/log/audit/audit.log.

2009-07-16  Chris PeBenito <cpebenito@tresys.com>

	* Change context parsing in libseaudit to use libselinux functions.

2009-06-04  Jeremy Solt <jsolt@tresys.com>

	* Add support for display of level and clearance of contexts to seaudit.
	* Add support for filterting by level and clearance to seaudit.

2009-05-26  Jeremy Solt <jsolt@tresys.com>

	* Modified seaudit to show the raw audit message when doubleclicking
	an entry.

2009-05-19  Steve Lawrence <slawrence@tresys.com>

	* Add libqpol and libapol support for policy capabilites and
	permissive domains.
	* Add policy capabilities and permissive domains querying to seinfo.

2009-05-15  Jeremy Solt <jsolt@tresys.com>

	* Add support for using attribute names available in version 24
	binary policies.

2008-09-11  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Fixed error in qpol_policy_rebuild_opt() where a policy's
	neverallow rules are expanded when the rebuild option is
	QPOL_POLICY_OPTION_NO_RULES.

2008-08-15  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* This is the official release of SETools 3.3.5.

	* Fixed errors in libapol's AV and TE rule rendering functions
	where errno was not being set properly.
	
	* Fixed error in apol_syn_avrule_render() where braces were not
	being added around the target set when there is exactly one target
	type and the keyword 'self'.  Thanks to Ryan Kagin for reporting
	this error.

2008-08-14  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Synched libqpol to libsepol version 2.0.32, policy parser to
	2.0.16.

	* Synched libqpol to libsepol version 2.0.26, policy parser to
	2.0.14.

	* Added qpol_type_get_ispermissive().  SETools can now handle
	version 23 policy; bumped libqpol to version 1.4.

2008-03-07  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* This is the official release of SETools 3.3.4.

	* debian/control: Added transitional packages for libapol1,
	libseaudit1, libsefs1, and their associated development package.

	* packages/rpm/fc9-compile.diff: Added a patch to allow building
	of SETools on Fedora 9, due to possible buggy gcc/glibc-header
	interaction in libseaudit/swig/python.

2008-03-05  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Fixes to libapol and libqpol to allow SETools to compile under
	gcc/g++ 4.3.

	* Added autodetection of Tk, needed for Tk 8.5.

	* Synced libqpol to policy parser to 2.0.13.

2008-02-29  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Synced libqpol to libsepol version 2.0.23, policy parser to
	2.0.10.

2008-02-21  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* This is the official release of SETools 3.3.3.

	* Fixes to qpol_default_policy_find() to properly return policies
	whose versions are greater than the currently running system.

2008-02-19  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added QPOL_POLICY_OPTION_MATCH_SYSTEM as a policy load option to
	qpol_policy_open_from_file().  The tools seinfo, sesearch, and
	sechecker will now use this flag when loading the system's default
	policy.

	* Modified libqpol to understand version 22 policy.  Added
	QPOL_CAP_POLCAPS to qpol_capability enum.

2008-02-15  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Synced libqpol to libsepol version 2.0.20.  The configure script
	will check if dynamic avtabs exist (introduced in libsepol 2.0.20)
	and will adjust policy loading as necessary.

2008-01-09  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added initial attempt at Debian-izing SETools.  The Debian
	control files are only present in the SVN checkout of SETools, not
	in the distributed tarball.

2007-11-02  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Ported bug fixes in branches/setools-devel to trunk.  This is
	the official release of SETools 3.3.2.

	* Fixed error in libsefs/Java where the library has not been built
	correctly since version 4 of libsefs.

2007-10-31  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Fix to libqpol when querying policies with no genfscon statements.

	* Fix to SWIG wrappers to correctly report exceptions in multi-threaded
	  Java environments.

2007-10-31  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Modifed libqpol to explicitly ignore disabled aliases.

	* Merged RedHat's spec file changes.

2007-10-08  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Fix to libqpol when qpol_type_get_alias_iter() could erroneously
	be set to an initially wrong position for certain primary types.

2007-10-02  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Fix to libqpol to synthesize object_r.  This was previously
	(erroneously) handled in libapol.

2007-09-26  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Fix to apol where empty levels would throw an error during
	validation.

2007-09-04  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Fixes to libsefs and apol if an invalid regular expression is
	given.

2007-08-30  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Do not look for neverallow rules on default avrule query if not
	available.

2007-08-22  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Ported bug fixes in branches/setools-devel to trunk.  This is
	the official release of SETools 3.3.1.

2007-08-20  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Fixed memory leak in libapol/infoflow analysis, where edges were
	not being freed.  Thanks to Ben Martin for spotting this error.

2007-08-16  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Fixed an error in libapol's infoflow.  When performing a
	transitive search, let there be an intermediate rule with source
	A, an attribute.  If a member of A, type T, is excluded by not
	calling apol_infoflow_analysis_append_intermediate(), it was still
	possible to return an infoflow result that uses T.  This has been
	fixed.

2007-08-13  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Fix error in libsefs when querying a filesystem or fcfile by
	range, but the fclist is not MLS.

2007-08-06  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* configure.ac: Tk is checked only if --enable-swig-tcl and
	--enable-gui are given.  Also, if tclconfig.sh is not found, then
	abort configuration.

	* apol/top.tcl: Fixed error where reading from an older .apol file
	(from SETools < 3.2) would cause a startup problem.

	* libapol/include/apol/domain-trans-analysis.h: Upon invalid
	transition, empty vectors are returned rather than NULL pointers.

2007-08-02  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Official release of SETools 3.3.

2007-08-02  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Corrected sechecker module incomplete domain transitions
	  to once again return results for missing RBAC and user policy
	  for transitions that have sufficient type enforcement rules.

2007-07-27  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Library jar files are now installed in
	$PREFIX/share/setools-<version>, with symlinks in
	$PREFIX/share/java.  They used to be placed in
	$PREFIX/lib/setools.

	* Added framework for CUnit tests for libseaudit.

2007-07-26  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Updated all linker map and SWIG interface files to match
	exported library headers.

	* libseaudit/src/filter.c (seaudit_filter_set_match): Added
	ability to set strictness of libseaudit filters.  Be default,
	filters are not strict; this matches previous libseaudit behavior.
	See seaudit_filter_set_match() for definition of "strictness".

2007-07-26  M. Goldman <mgoldman@tresys.com>
	* Added tooltip to glade interface noting that diffing never
	  allow rules could dramaticly increase run time

	* Fixed names in sediffx to be more descriptive (the tree view
	  in the upper left hand corner).  Names changed from
	  AVRules auditallow to Audit Allow Rules as an example.

2007-07-24  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added framework for CUnit tests for libapol.

2007-07-23  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added framework for CUnit tests for libpoldiff and libqpol.
	configure now has the option --with-test-policies to specify where
	the test policies reside.

2007-07-20  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added seaudit_filter for PID.

2007-07-19  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added many optimizations to qpol_policy_build_syn_rule_table()
	and associated functions.  With some code rewrites, a doubling of
	the syntactic rule hash table size, and an improved hashing
	function, it is at least three times faster to build the table.

2007-07-18  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Fixed error in libpoldiff where if an AV or a TE rule was within
	a conditional that had multiple boolean variables, the diff
	algorithm would generate an incorrect STC key for that rule.

2007-07-17  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Updated domain transition analysis to use the BST internally;
	  this should result in improved performance.

2007-07-13  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Java SWIG libraries now check if the libraries needs to be
	loaded before doing such.

	* Added more filtering options to libseaudit.

2007-07-12  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* seaudit_filter_set_ipaddress() is renamed to
	seaudit_filter_set_anyaddr().  seaudit_filter_set_port() is now
	seaudit_filter_set_anyport().  Similar changes occurred to the
	respective accessors.

2007-07-11  M. Goldman  <mgoldman@tresys.com>

	* Split functions relating to item records out into their own
	  file.  Added documentation for same.

2007-07-09  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added additional sort constructors to libseaudit.

2007-07-05  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* seaudit now has a button to clear all messages from a view.
	This is useful when doing log monitoring, to show only new
	messages.

	* Added seaudit_model_hide_message(), to suppress display of
	certain messages within a model.

2007-06-28  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Updated apol and sediffx to delay loading neverallow rules
	unless the user requested analyzing them.

2007-06-25  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Updated apol(1) to use new libsefs

	* Updated replcon(1) to use new libsefs.

2007-06-19  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Updated indexcon(1) to use new libsefs.

	* Merged searchcon(1) functionality into findcon(1); man pages
	updated.  searchcon(1) has been removed from SETools.

	* libsefs.so.4 is now wrapped by SWIG, for Python, Java, and
	Tcl.

	* Rewrite of libsefs to meet coding standards.  libsefs.so.4 is an
	object-oriented library that abstracts away filesystems,
	file_contexts files, and databases into a unified object that can
	be queried easily.

2007-06-18  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* libpoldiff/include/poldiff/rbac_diff.h: Added
	poldiff_role_allow_get_unmodified_roles().  The return values
	poldiff_role_allow_get_added_roles() and
	poldiff_role_allow_get_removed_roles() have been changed for forms
	POLDIFF_FORM_ADDED and POLDIFF_FORM_REMOVED.

2007-06-14  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* SETools can now compile against GTK+ 2.4.  Nonetheless, GTK+ 2.8
	is still the recommended toolkit.

2007-06-13  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* libseaudit/src/log.c (seaudit_log_clear): Added ability to clear
	a log of its messages.

2007-06-12  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* SETools now requires libsqlite3, version 3.2.0 or greater.  It
	used to ship with its own copy of sqlite3; that is no longer the
	case.

2007-06-11  M. Goldman  <mgoldman@tresys.com>
	* Updated swig interface to properly expose av and te rule
	  vector accessor functions for libpoldiff.

2007-06-08  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Fixed an error in libpoldiff where
	  poldiff_terule_get_modified_default() was returning the
	  original default; it now correctly returns the modified
	  default type.

2007-06-08  M. Goldman <mgoldman@tresys.com>

	* updated sediffx diffs so that the subrules for avrules and
	  terules are broken out into allow, neverallow, auditallow,
	  dontaudit type_member, type_change, and type_transition rules

2007-06-04  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added convert functions to apol_context_t and
	apol_mls_range_t; added constructors
	apol_mls_range_create_from_string() and
	apol_mls_range_create_from_literal().

2007-05-31  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* libapol/src/util.c (apol_str_to_objclass): Added this function,
	as the complement to apol_objclass_to_str().

	* libapol/src/mls_level.c (apol_mls_level_is_literal),
	  libapol/src/mls_range.c (apol_mls_range_is_literal): Added
	  ability to query if level/range is literal.  This is needed when
	  printing an apol_context_t containing a literal level.

	* libapol: split mls-query.h into mls-query.h, mls_level.h, and
	mls_range.h.  This file was much too large.

2007-05-30  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* libapol/src/mls-query.c (apol_mls_level_create_from_literal)
	(apol_mls_level_convert): The apol_mls_level_t object can now be
	created without relying upon a policy.  Call
	apol_mls_level_convert() to complete its category list.

2007-05-30  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* The --regex flag in sesearch now also applies to --class.

2007-05-29  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* ./configure no longer has --enable-sefs flag, for libselinux is
	required to build SETools.  (The kernel does need to have SELinux
	running, though.)  Therefore, libsefs is now always built.

	* apol converted to use the SWIG interface for Tcl.

	* libapol/src/types-relation-analysis.c
	(apol_types_relation_domain): Domain transition table was not
	correctly reset when intermixing calls between
	apol_types_relation_analysis_do() and
	apol_domain_trans_analysis_do().

2007-05-22  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added infoflow defines to apol.i.  Added apol_file_find_path()
	to apol.i.  They were inadvertently missing from the interface
	file.

2007-05-22  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Renamed apol_permmap_*() to apol_policy_*_permmap() to
	  correctly reflect the fact that the policy owns the permmap.

2007-05-21  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Renamed apol_policy_domain_trans_table_build() and
	  apol_domain_trans_table_reset() to apol_policy_build_domain_trans_table()
	  and apol_polciy_reset_domain_trans_table() respectively.  This change
	  reflects the correct namespace for these operations.

2007-05-18  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Deprecated qpol_policy_extend(); this function is called
	  automatically by qpol_policy_open* and qpol_policy_rebuild()
	  and therefore does not need to be called separately.

2007-05-16  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Right-clicking an apol results display now pops up a menu, that
	allows the user to copy and to select all.

	* libapol/swig/apol.i: Within the SWIG interfaces, there now
	exists an object "apol_ip_t", that represents both an IP address
	and a protocol.  apol_str_to_internal_ip() returns an apol_ip_t,
	which may then be used when setting an apol_nodecon_query_t.  Note
	that this only affects the SWIG generated libraries, not the
	original libapol.

	* SETools now requires a C99 compliant C compiler.  The supplied
	configure script will check for a working C99 compiler.

2007-05-16  M. Goldman  <mgoldman@tresys.com>
	* modified libpoldiff to support partial diffing of avrules

	* modified sediff to expose partial diffing of avrules functionality

2007-05-15  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* libqpol/src/mls_query.c (qpol_level_get_alias_iter): Fixed
	possible error when getting a level's alias iterator, where the
	first element returned might be the original level instead of one
	of its alias.

	* libapol/include/apol/policy-path.h, libapol/include/apol/util.h:
	Headers errantly included <config.h>.

	* libapol/src/netcon-query.c (apol_nodecon_query_set_proto)
	(apol_portcon_query_set_proto): These have been renamed to
	apol_nodecon_query_set_protocol() and
	apol_portcon_query_set_protocol() respectively.

	* libapol/src/util.c (apol_str_to_protocol): Added this function,
	to complement existing apol_protocol_to_str().

	* libapol/src/mls-query.c (apol_mls_range_contain_subrange): Fixed
	potential segfault if a range's high level is not yet set when
	comparison occurs.

2007-05-14  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* correctly marked libqpol defines for genfscon object classes
	  and fs_use behaviors as unsigned constants.

2007-05-14  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* libapol/src/role-query.c (apol_role_get_by_query),
	libapol/src/user-query.c (apol_user_get_by_query): Extra logic
	added when "object_r" is given as the role.  For user queries, all
	users implicitly have object_r assigned to them.  For role
	queries, all types are assigned to object_r.

	* libapol/swig/apol.i: apol_context_validate() and
	apol_context_validate_partial() are now member functions of class
	apol_context_t, rather than being a library function.

	* libapol/include/mls-query.h (apol_mls_cat_name_compare): Removed
	apol_mls_cat_name_compare() from the libapol public API.  This
	function should never have been made public.

	* libapol/src/context-query.c: Fixed potential segfaults in
	modifiers to apol_context_t object, if the same pointer returned
	by its accessor is then passed back in the modifier modifier.

	* libapol/src/context-query.c (apol_context_render): When
	rendering a partial context, unset fields are now explicitly
	represented by an asterisk, rather than by an empty string.

2007-05-11  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* removed usage of typedef'ed bool_t and replaced with bool as
	  defined by stdbool.h; also replaced defined TRUE and FALSE
	  with true and false constants as defined by stdbool.h.

2007-05-11  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Fix potential segfaults in apol_mls_range functions if the high
	level is not set.

	* Added apol_mls_level_validate() to SWIG wrappers.  Added
	apol_mls_range_get_low() and apol_mls_range_get_high().
	apol_mls_range_validate() is now a member function of class
	apol_mls_range_t, rather than a library function.

	* Within the SWIG wrappers, apol_mls_level_get_cats() returns a
	vector.  This should have been a string vector instead.

	* Added function apol_mls_level_validate().

2007-05-10  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added setools-libs-tcl target to setools.spec.

	* Removed apol/apol.c; apol is now just a Tcl script that is
	executed by tclsh, rather than a custom compiled Tcl interpreter.

	* Removed the deprecated header apol/avl-util.h and its associated
	source file.

2007-05-08  M. Goldman  <mgoldman@tresys.com>
	* Added next and previous buttons to seaudit

	* Added apol_bst_inorder_map()

2007-05-07  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Changed apol_ipv4_addr_render so that it now takes an array
	  of uint32_t's instead of a single uint32_t.

	* Changed SWIG wrapping for apol_perm_query_t::run() to return
	  apol_string_vector_t instead of apol_vector_t.

	* Added exported pointers to SWIG wrappers of each library
	  to allow changing of the message handler callback and its
	  void * argument.

	* qpol_policy_rebuild() no longer requires a modular policy;
	  it can safely be called for any type of policy.

2007-05-04  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Fixed qpol_module function names in the libqpol SWIG wrappers.

2007-05-04  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Added SWIG wrappers for tcl to libpoldiff and libseaudit.

2007-05-02  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Versioned symbols in other libraries.

2007-05-01  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Versioned symbols in libqpol to allow conditional expansion
	  of neverallow rules from qpol_policy_open_from_*.

2007-05-01  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added apol_avrule_query_set_all_perms().  This changes the
	behavior when matching multiple permissions.

2007-04-30  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added --enable-swig-tcl flag to configure script.

2007-04-25  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Official release of SETools-3.2.

2007-04-20  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added seaudit_log_parse_buffer(), needed because
	seaudit_log_parse() is not possible with the Java SWIG library.

	* Build system updated to suppress warnings from automake
	1.10, and for parallel compilation (i.e., make -j).

2007-04-18  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* The function apol_domain_trans_result_create_from_domain_trans_result()
	  is now publicly exported. Also added is apol_domain_trans_result_destroy()
	  to free memory used by duplicated results.

2007-04-17  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Fixed potential segfault in seaudit_filter_set_date() when
	called using the same struct tm pointers that were returned by
	seaudit_filter_get_date().  The old code would dereference
	memory that was just free()d.

2007-04-16  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* apol_mls_range_get_levels() fixed so that its returned levels
	only include categories that are valid for the given policy.
	Before it just copied the categories for the high level, even if a
	lower level could not actually have one of those categories.

	* apol_mls_level_get_cats() now always returns categories in
	alphabetical order.

2007-04-06  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added seaudit_avc_message_get_name() and
	seaudit_sort_by_name().  seaudit now shows AVC messages' name
	field; this column may be be hidden through the updated
	preferences dialog.

	* Updated libqpol to use libsepol >= 2.0.0 if available.
	configure should be able to autodetect this.

2007-04-05  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* sediffx now allows the user to select which components to diff,
	rather than always diffing everything.

	* fix to domain transition analysis, where setexec rules might not
	be found correctly given certain policies.

2007-04-04  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* New configure option --enable-swig-java to enable build of Java
	SWIG wrappers.

2007-04-03  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Added apol_file_is_policy_path_list() to validate policy path
	  list files.

	* Added ability to specify policy path list files from command
	  line for all tools taking a policy as an argument.

2007-04-02  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Removed the "all_files" symbol from libsefs; this symbol was
	  previously marked as deprecated.

2007-03-29  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Libpoldiff SWIG wrapper added; wrapper treats all structures as
	  classes in the target language.

2007-03-28  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Introduced 'policy list' in apol, seaudit, and sediffx.  This is
	a small text file that contains references to a base policy and
	any number of modules.

2007-03-27  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added apol_policy_path_create_from_file() and
	apol_policy_path_to_file().

	* apol_str_trim() no longer has a return value; it also operates
	directly on a string, rather than a reference to a string.

	* apol_vector_t and apol_bst_t now require a destructor function
	to be given during creation time, rather than being passed as a
	second parameter respectively to apol_vector_destroy() and
	apol_bst_destroy().  All of SETools has been updated to this
	scheme.

2007-03-26  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* apol_context_t is now an opaque structure.  Accessors added to
	the user, role, type, and range fields.

2007-03-23  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added apol_mls_level_get_sens() and apol_mls_level_get_cats().

2007-03-23  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Libseaudit SWIG wrapper added; wrapper treats all structures as
	  classes in the target language.

2007-03-23  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* apol_mls_level_t and apol_mls_range_t are now opaque structures.

	* fixed error in seaudit_model_create_from_model(), where the
	duplicate's filters and sorts were being linked to the original
	model, not the newly created one.

	* fixed potential segfault in seaudit_filter_set_name() and
	seaudit_filter_set_description() if the passed in pointer was the
	same one obtained by the respecitve accessor function.

2007-03-22  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Libapol SWIG wrapper updated to treat all structures as classes
	  in the target language.

2007-03-21  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added ability for user to specify type joins and splits in
	sediffx.  The libpoldiff library had always supported this
	feature; it just was not available through the user interface.

2007-03-20  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Renamed apol_domain_trans_table_destroy to domain_trans_table_destroy
	  and moved to policy-query-internal.h; this function was not intended
	  for external use.

2007-03-19  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* When viewing AV rule differences, click (either left or right) a
	permission name.  This will now popup a menu that gives line
	numbers for rules that contributed just that permission, rather
	than the entire AV rule.  This is enabled when source policies are
	used.

2007-03-16  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added poldiff_avrule_get_orig_line_numbers_for_perm() and
	poldiff_avrule_get_mod_line_numbers_for_perm().

2007-03-15  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Split libpoldiff/include/rule_diff.h into
	libpoldiff/include/avrule_diff.h and
	libpoldiff/include/terule_diff.h.  None of the function names were
	changed.

	* Re-standardized all programs' command line options.  -V always
	shows the version, -c always deals with object classes, and so
	forth.  Man pages updated.

	* Renamed libapol/include/rangetrans-query.h to
	libapol/include/range_trans-query.h.  Likewise renamed
	libpoldiff's rangetrans_diff.h  None of the function names were
	changed.

2007-03-13  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* fixed segfault in libseaudit when, while parsing an AVC
	message's permissions list it does not encounter a closing brace.

	* information flow graphs are now being constructed via a BST and
	its O(log n), rather than via a vector and O(n).  It should be
	noticeably faster now.

	* fixed error in information flow analysis, transitive mode.  The
	returned flows were mistakenly all set to be the same object
	class.  For example if a step was foo_t -> bar_t by way of class
	baz_c, subsequent flows were accidentally being constrained to
	also be of baz_c.

	* fixed error in apol_bst_insert() and apol_bst_insert_and_get(),
	where the return values of 0 and 1 were flipped.  The comment was
	correct, but the code was not.

2007-03-12  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* fixed share libraries's soname, such that SETools's programs
	depend upon the correct name.  For example, seaudit's .dynamic
	section should have as a dependency on libseaudit.so.4, not
	libseaudit.so.4.1.

	* sediffx now diffs and displays range transitions

	* sediff -E now diffs range transitions

	* range transition diff added libpoldiff

2007-03-08  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* poldiff_user_get_added_roles() and
	poldiff_user_get_removed_roles() now return all roles when the
	form is POLDIFF_FORM_ADDED / POLDIFF_FORM_REMOVED.

	* sediffx updated to show users' MLS differences

2007-03-07  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* in libpoldiff, if either policy is MLS then when diffing users,
	those users' default MLS level and assigned ranges are also
	diffed.

	* added poldiff_range_t object

	* fixed segfault in libqpol when loading an invalid source policy

	* error messages were not being shown correctly in apol's open
	policy dialog; fixed.

2007-03-06  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* added SWIG wrapper for libqpol. The wrapper treats all libqpol
	structs as classes in the target language.

2007-03-06  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* apol_mls_level_create() will now always return an allocated (and
	empty) category vector as part of the level.  Before it would
	initialize the field as NULL.

	* poldiff_avrule_get_unmodified_perms() no longer returns all
	permissions whenever a rule is added or removed; it only returns
	permissions when the form is POLDIFF_FORM_MODIFIED.  The new
	behavior matches the other policy components.

2007-03-05  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added apol_mls_level_free() and apol_mls_range_get_levels()

2007-03-02  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* qpol_user_get_range() and qpol_user_get_dfltlevel() now return
	NULL if the policy is not MLS.  (It used to return a garbage
	pointer.)

2007-03-01  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added additional accessors to the seaudit_avc_message_t object.

2007-02-28  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added apol_mls_level_create_from_mls_level() and
	apol_mls_range_create_from_mls_range() copy constructors.

	* Fixed segfault when libseaudit attempts to parse certain load
	policy messages.

2007-02-23  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Implemented new sediffx results design.  Results are implemented
	as subclasses of an abstract result_item_t class.  This will allow
	easier future modifications of the sediffx interface.

2007-02-21  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* fixed segfault when opening a policy with
	APOL_POLICY_OPTION_NO_RULES when the policy has an unconditional
	type_transition rule.

2007-02-16  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Moved libqpol/include/qpol/expand.h to libqpol/src/expand.h.
	This header file was never supposed to be visible.

	* added SWIG wrappers to libapol; build system updated.  configure
	must be passed --enable-swig-python to build the wrappers.

2007-02-14  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* sesearch and apol now allow searching range transitions based
	upon the target class.  (Target classes were introduced in version
	21 policies.)

	* added to apol_range_trans_query_append_class() to
	libapol/include/apol/rangetrans-query.h

2007-02-07  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* split --audit flag in sesearch to --auditallow and --dontaudit;
	  the --audit flag is now deprecated.

2007-02-06  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Official release of SETools-3.1.

	* Compile fixes for 64-bit Linux.

2007-02-02  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added RPM spec files.

2007-01-30  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* fixed error in apol when right-clicking an attribute when a file
	contexts database is loaded.

	* fixed error in SQLite configuration in which a pointer size was
	defined as the size of an integer.  this is a no longer valid
	assumption on 64-bit architectures.

	* if apol has a modular policy loaded, then its "policy version"
	for purposes of permission maps is now set to the maximum policy
	version as defined in libsepol.  this mimics the linking behavior
	of sepol.

2007-01-25  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* fixed error where aliases within modules were not being detected
	properly

2007-01-19  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* all files now have correct copyright and license notices

2007-01-19  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* updated all help documentation

2007-01-17  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* updated all man pages

2007-01-17  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added poldiff_type_remap_entry_get_is_inferred()

	* sediffx converted to use modular policies.

2007-01-08  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* apol converted to use modular policies.

2007-01-05  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Added capability QPOL_CAP_SOURCE to detect ability to display
	  the policy source.

	* Deprecated qpol_policy_is_mls_enabled() use
	  qpol_policy_has_capability() for QPOL_CAP_MLS instead.

2007-01-04  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* seaudit converted to use modular policies.

2007-01-03  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Deprecated apol_policy_open() and apol_policy_open_no_rules();
	use apol_policy_create_from_policy_path() instead.

2006-12-14  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Added apol_policy_path_t object.  This is needed because policy
	paths are not just a single string, but rather a base policy and
	any number of modules.

	* New functions apol_config_join_var() generalized to be
	apol_str_join().  Same with apol_config_split_var() ->
	apol_str_split().

2006-12-12  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Renamed qpol_find_default_policy_file() in qpol/policy.h to
	qpol_default_policy_find() in qpol/util.h.  Removed
	qpol_find_default_policy_file_strerr().  These functions were
	never supposed to be in these locations.

	* Deprecated apol_policy_is_binary(); use qpol policy capabilities
	instead.

	* Deprecated qpol_open_policy_from_file(); it is now called
	qpol_policy_open_from_file().  Similar change to
	qpol_open_policy_from_file_no_rules() and
	qpol_open_policy_from_memory().

	* Merged qpol/policy_query.h into qpol/policy.h.  Split module
	related code into qpol/module.h.

	* Rewrite of seaudit to utilize libseaudit.so.4; tweaked numerous
	interface issues.

	* Rewrite of libseaudit to meet coding standards.  libseaudit.so.4
	is now a shared object file with proper namespacing.

2006-12-11  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* Added qpol_policy_has_capability() to qpol/policy_query.h
	This function and the enumeration qpol_capability_e allows
	a user of the library to check if a loaded policy is
	capable of supporting various policy features.

	* Support has been added to libqpol for loading policy modules.
	See qpol/policy.h for details.

2006-12-01  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* deprecated apol_config_get_varlist() and
	apol_config_varlist_to_str(); added apol_file_find_path(),
	apol_config_split_var(), and apol_config_join_var()

2006-12-01  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Official release of SETools 3.0.1.

2006-11-29  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* synced source parser to libsepol 1.15.2.

2006-11-27  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added application icons to apol, seaudit, and sediffx

2006-11-09  j. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* added __cplusplus guards to all external headers

2006-11-08  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* apol_permmap_t is now a hidden declaration.
	apol_permmap_destroy() has been removed.  (It should never have
	been publicly visible.)

	* apol_policy_t is now an opaque structure.  Added accessors such
	as apol_policy_get_qpol() to retrieve some of those fields.  This
	also means that the apol callback function changed, so as to be
	similar to qpol's callback.

2006-11-07  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* renamed apol_get_*_by_query() to apol_*_get_by_query to match
	  naming conventions of other functions. Old versions were retained and
	  marked as deprecated.

2006-11-02  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added apol_str_strdup() (declared in apol/util.h)

	* apol_vector_create_from_vector() takes two additional arguments,
	so that it can act more like a copy constructor.


2006-11-01  J. Mowery  <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* added ability for avrule and terule queries to search to only types or
	  only attributes for both source and target fields (separate option for
	  each field, default is to search both types and attributes).

	* added apol_get_syn_avrule_by_query() and apol_get_syn_terule_by_query()

2006-10-27  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added apol_str_appendf() (declared in apol/util.h)

2006-10-27  J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* added make indent to standardize code indentation style

	* indented all .c and .h files with make indent (except sqlite which it skips)

2006-10-25  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* seaudit-report Logwatch script will look for
	$(bindir)/seaudit-report, rather than the hard-coded
	/usr/bin/seaudit-report

2006-10-25 J. Mowery <jmowery@tresys.com>

	* numbered steps for loading

	* loading syntactic rule table is now off by default

	* updated tools requiring line numbers to build syntactic table as needed

2006-10-24  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* exclude the sqlite files from the Doxygen configuration

2006-10-19  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* added lib<foo>_get_version() functions to libqpol, libpoldiff,
	and libsefs

2006-10-17  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* seaudit-report binary was mistakenly called "seaudit_report"

	* Updated man pages to match programs' help files.

2006-10-13  J. Tang  <jtang@tresys.com>

	* Official release of SETools 3.0.
