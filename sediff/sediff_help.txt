Semantic Policy Difference Tool for Security Enhanced Linux


Overview:
---------
The sediff and sediffx programs are policy analysis tools that take
two policies and compare them, showing a list of the differences.  The
former is a command-line only program while the latter is a GTK+
application.  They can compare source, monolithic binary, and modular
binary policies; they can also compare different versions of policy.
The two programs support source policies versions 12 and higher,
monolithic binary versions 15 and higher, and modular binary versions
5 and higher.


Limitations:
------------
The programs currently compare the following policy elements:
  - commons and object classes
  - levels and categories
  - types and attributes
  - roles
  - users
  - booleans
  - access vector rules (allow, neverallow, etc.)
  - type rules (type_transition, type_member, etc.)
  - role allow rules
  - role transition rules
  - range transition rules


What is a Semantic Diff?
------------------------
The challenge with comparing two policies is that a straightforward
textual comparison is of little value.  What one needs is the ability
to determine semantically how two policies differ.  For example, one
could not simply grep for allow rules with a given type, and then
compare them to a similar list from another policy.  Many factors
affect the semantic meaning of the rules.  For example, multiple rules
can allow differing sets of permissions.  Attributes can allow
permissions to or from a type.  What was a type in one policy could
become an alias in another.

What sediff and sediffx do are analyze each policy semantically.  We
define "semantically" as how the kernel security server uses a policy
to make enforcement decisions.  This approach also allows binary and
source policies to be compared, as well as different versions of
policies.

NOTE: The one semantic assumption sediff and sediffx make is that when
an identifier (e.g., a type name) has the same string value in each
policy, then it represents the same semantic meaning in both policies.


sediff and sediffx Commands:
----------------------------
Policies may be differentiated upon the command line (see "sediff
--help") or in a graphical environment (see "sediffx --help").  The
sediffx tool is recommend because it gives additional details about
policy differences and affords type remappings.  The remainder of this
document focuses on sediffx.


Understanding sediffx's Results: 
--------------------------------
After calculating differences between two policies, the GUI shows the
compared policy components in the top-left frame.  Besides each policy
component is a number representing the total number of differences for
that component.  Select a policy component to show detailed results in
the right-hand window.

NOTE: All differences are shown from the perspective of the first
policy given (i.e., "original policy") to the second ("modified
policy").  There are five types of differences shown:

  - Added (+): A policy component was added by the second policy (in
    modified policy but not original policy).

  - Removed (-): A policy component was removed by the second policy
    (in original policy but not modified policy).

  - Modified (*): A policy component was present in both policies, but
    is different in the modified policy.

Where appropriate, two other differences are possible:

  - Added because of new type (+): This policy component could not
    exist in the original policy because that policy does not declare
    a necessary type.

  - Removed because of missing type (-): This policy component could
    not exist in the modified policy because that policy no longer
    declares a necessary type.


Supported Policy Areas Differences:
-----------------------------------
Below is an explanation of the difference for each supported policy
area:

  Commons:
  --------
  Classes can be added, removed, or modified.  Modified means that
  the list of permissions associated with a common is different.

  Classes:
  --------
  Classes are compared much like commons.  They too may be added,
  removed, or modified.

  Levels:
  -------
  If either policy is MLS then levels will be compared.  Levels can be
  added or removed; a modified level means that the categories
  assigned to its corresponding sensitivity has changed.  Be aware
  that levels' aliases are ignored by the diff algorithm.

  Categories:
  -----------
  If either policy is MLS then categories will be compared.  They can
  be added or removed; there is no such thing as a "modified"
  category.  Be aware that categories' aliases are ignored by the
  diff algorithm.

  Types:
  ------
  Types can be added, removed, or modified.  Modified means that the
  attributes associated with a type are different between the two
  policies.

  Attributes:
  -----------
  Attributes are compared like types.  They can be added, removed,
  or modified.  Modified means that the types associated with the
  attributes are different (types can be added or removed from the
  attribute).

  Roles:
  ------
  Roles can be added, removed, or modified.  Modified means that the
  types associated with a role are different between the two policies.
  Types can be added or removed from a role.

  Users:
  ------
  Users can be added, removed, or modified.  Modified means that the
  roles associated with a user are different between the two policies.
  Roles can be added or removed from a user.  In addition, if either
  policy is MLS then the users' ranges and default levels are also
  compared.

  Booleans:
  ---------
  Booleans can be added, removed, or modified.  If comparing a version
  15 or earlier policy with a version 16 or later policy, all the
  booleans will be added or removed, for booleans were introduced in
  version 16.  Modified means that the default value is different
  between the two policies.

  AV Rules:
  ---------
  Finding differences in access vector rules (allow, neverallow, etc.)
  consumes the majority of time when diffing two policies.  The rule
  comparison is truly semantic.  All issues of redundancy and
  duplication, as well as indirect access through attributes are
  resolved.  All rules are keyed by the "source-target-class" (STC)
  triple.  In addition, conditional rules are distinguished from
  non-conditional rules.  Thus, for example, two rules with the same
  STC will not be compared if one is non-conditional and the other is
  conditional, or if both are conditional but conditioned on two
  different conditional expressions.  For conditional rules, the
  conditional expression is compared to ensure that conditional rules
  are meaningfully compared.  In the results pane, conditional rules
  are displayed with their associated conditional expression and if
  the rule was in conditional's TRUE or FALSE branch.

  NOTE: For conditional rules, the default and current values of
  the booleans are ignored.  Conditional expressions are compared
  as if all booleans were in the same state.

  Rules can be added, removed, or modified.  Added means the STC
  triple for that rule is not present in the original policy but in
  the modified one.  Removed means the STC triple is present in the
  original but not modified policy.  Modified means that the
  permissions for the rule are different between the policies.

  When source policies are compared, hyperlinked line numbers are
  shown that takes the user to the policy's source where the rule was
  defined.  If there were more than one source rules that contributed
  to a STC triple for a given rule, then all relevant source rules are
  linked.  Furthermore, the user may click upon an individual
  permission to obtain a list of lines that contributed just that
  permission.

  Type Rules:
  -----------
  Type rules are type_transition, type_member, and type_change.  They
  are differentiated much like AV rules in that their STCs are used as
  keys.  For type rules, modified means that the default type is
  different between the policies.

  Role Allows:
  ------------
  Role allow rules determine if a role is allowed to transition to
  another role.  Diffing a role allow involves taking the source role
  and checking to see if there are corresponding rules in the other
  policy with the same source role.  A modified role allow means the
  same source exist in both policies but target roles differ.

  Role Transitions:
  -----------------
  Role transitions are keyed against both the source role and target
  type.  If a role transition exists in both policies but has a
  different default role then it is marked as modified.

  Range Transitions:
  ------------------
  Range transitions have a STC much like AV rules.  A modified range
  transition indicates a difference in the rules' target ranges.  This
  could be either a difference in level or in minimal category set.
  

Policy Tabs:
------------
Each policy has a tab on the main window labeled Policy #: followed by
the policy file name.  Under these tabs are a policy statistics tab
and a source tab.

  Policy Statistics Tab:
  ----------------------
  The policy statistics tab displays a summary of that policy's
  contents.
    
  Source Tab:
  -----------
  If the policy is a source policy, this tab displays the source of
  that policy.


Remapping Types:
----------------
The diff algorithm implicitly treats a type with the same name across
both policies as the same semantic item.  This includes a name that
was a type in one policy but became an alias in the other.  There may
be instances where the operator has special knowledge of the remaining
unmapped types.  From sediffx's main interface, select "Remap Types"
from the Tools menu to open a dialog box.  Add additional remappings
between types as necessary.

There are times when a one-to-one mapping is not sufficient for
analysis purposes.  Occasionally a type is "split" into two or more
types; conversely multiple types are "joined" into a single type.  For
example, a policy has the type "games_t" for a number of programs.  At
some point in the future the policy writer decides to give NetHack its
own type, "nethack_t".  To represent this type split in sediffx, go to
the Remap Types dialog.  There should already be an inferred mapping
from the original policy's games_t to the modified policy.  Add a new
mapping from games_t to nethack_t.  The mappings list will be updated
to show that games_t now maps to both games_t and nethack_t.
