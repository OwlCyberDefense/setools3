Overview:
---------
The sediff and sediffx programs are policy analysis tools that parse
two given policy files and compares them showing a list of the
differences; the former is a command-line only program while the
latter is a GTK+ application.  They can compare source and/or binary
policies and can also compare different versions of policy.  For
source policies, versions 12 and higher of SELinux policies are
supported.  For binary policies, versions 15 and higher are supported.

Limitations:
------------
The programs currently compare the following policy elements:
  - object classes and permissions
  - types and attributes
  - roles
  - users
  - booleans
  - type enforcement rules (allow, type_transitions, etc.)
  - role allow rules
  - role transition rules


What is a Semantic Diff?
------------------------
The challenge with comparing two policies is that a straightforward
textual comparison is of little value.  What one needs is the ability
to determine semantically how two policies differ.  For example, one
could not simply grep for allow rules with a given type, and then
compare them to a similar list from another policy.  Many factors
affect the semantic meaning of the rules.  For example, multiple rules
can allow differing sets of permissions.  Attributes can allow
permissions to/from a type.  What was a type in one policy could
become an alias in another.

What sediff (and sediffx) does is analyze each policy semantically.
We define "semantically" as how the kernel security server uses a
policy to make enforcement decisions.  This approach also allows
binary and source policies to be compared, as well as different
versions of policies.

NOTE: The one semantic assumption sediff makes is that when an
identifier (e.g., a type name) has the same string value in each
policy, then it represents the same semantic meaning in both policies.


sediff Commands:
----------------
The tools may be run from the command line or in a graphical
environment.  For command line.  Use sediff (see "sediff --help") for
the command line and sediffx ("sediffx --help") for the graphical
interface.  We recommond using sediffx as that it gives additional
details about policy differences; the remainder of this document
focuses on sediffx.


Understanding sediffx's Results: 
--------------------------------

After calculating differences between two policies, the GUI shows the
policy areas compared in the left hand frame.  Besides each policy
area is a number representing the total number of differences in that
area.  As a general rule, for each policy area the right-hand window
shows the detailed results.

NOTE: All differences are shown from the perspective of the first
policy given (i.e., "original policy") to the second ("modified
policy").  There are three types of differences shown:

  - Added (+): A policy component was added by the second policy (in
    modified policy but not original policy).

  - Removed (-): A policy component was removed by the second policy
    (in original policy but not modified policy).

  - Modified (*): A policy component was present in both policies, but
    is different in the modified policy.


Supported Policy Areas Differences:
-----------------------------------
Below is an explanation of the difference for each supported policy
area:

  Classes:
  --------
  Classes can be added, removed, or modified.  Modified means that
  the list of permissions associated with aclass is different.

  Commons:
  --------
  Commons are compared much like classes.  They too may be added,
  removed, or modified.

  Types:
  ------
  Types can be added, removed, or modified.  Modified means that the
  attributes associated with a type are different between the two
  policies.  Because attribute names do not exist within binary
  policies, if either the original or modified policy is a binary then
  the 'modified' check will be skipped.

  Attributes:
  -----------
  Attributes are compared like types.  They can be added, removed,
  or modified.  Modified means that the types associated with the
  attributes are different (types can be added or removed from the
  attribute).  As before, if either policy is a binary then attributes
  will not be checked.

  Roles:
  ------
  Roles can be added, removed, or modified.  Modified means that the
  types associated with a role are different between the two policies.
  Types can be added or removed from a role.

  Users:
  ------
  Users can be added, removed, or modified.  Modified means that the
  roles associated with a user are different between the two
  policies.  Roles can be added or removed from a user.

  Booleans:
  ---------
  Booleans can be added, removed, or modified.  If you compare a
  version 15 or earlier policy with a version 16 or later policy, all
  the booleans will be added or removed (booleans came in version 16).
  Modified means that the default value is different between the two
  policies.

  TE Rules:
  ---------
  The TE rules areas covers the "meat" of a policy.  This area
  includes AV rules (allow, neverallow auditallow, and dontaudit) and
  Type rules (type_transition, type_change, and type_member).  The
  rule comparison is truly semantic.  All issues of redundancy and
  duplication, as well as indirect access through attributes are
  resolved.  All rules are keyed by the "source-target-class" (STC)
  triple.  In addition, conditional rules are distinguished from
  non-conditional rules.  Thus, for example, two rules with the same
  STC will not be compared if one is non-conditional and the other is
  conditional, or if both are conditional but conditioned on two
  different conditional expressions.  For conditional rules, the
  conditional expression is compared to ensure that conditional rules
  are meaningfully compared.  In the results pane, conditional rules
  are displayed with their associated conditional expression and if
  the rule was in conditional's TRUE or FALSE branch.

  NOTE: For conditional rules, the default and current values of
  the booleans are ignored.  Conditional expressions are compared
  as if the booleans were all the same.

  Rules can be added, removed, or modified.  Added means the STC
  triple for that rule is not present in the original policy but in
  the modified one.  Removed means the STC triple is present in the
  original but not modified policy.  For AV rules, modified means that
  the permissions for the rule are different between the policies.
  For Type rules, modified means that the default type is different
  between the policies.

  When source policies are compared, hyperlinked line numbers are
  shown that take you to the source ".conf" file where the rule was
  defined.  If there were more than one source rules that contributed
  to a STC triple for a given rule, then all source rules are linked.

  RBAC Rules:
  -----------
  RBAC includes role allow and role_transition rules.  Role allow
  rules determine if a role is allowed to transition to another role.
  Diffing a role allow involves taking the source role and checking to
  see if there are corresponding rules in the other policy.  If there
  is no rule with this source in the first policy it is an add.
  Likewise if there is none in the second policy it is a remove.  If
  role allows with the same source exist in both policies then the
  target roles are shown as a modified.  Role transitions are handled
  similarly to type_transitions; if the default role is different then
  the statement is marked as modified.


Policy Tabs:
------------
Each policy has a tab on the main window labeled Policy #: followed by
the policy file name.  Under each of these tabs are a policy
statistics tab and a source tab.

  Policy Statistics Tab:
  ----------------------
  The policy statistics tab displays the statistics of that policy.
    
  Source Tab:
  -----------
  If the policy is a source policy, this tab displays the source of
  that policy.


Remapping Types:
----------------
The sediff algorithm implicitly treats a type with the same name
across both policies as the same semantic item.  This includes a name
that was a type in one policy but became an alias in the other.  There
may be instances where the operator has special knowledge of the
remaining unmapped types.  In this case, he may use sediffx's "Remap
Types" dialog to explicitly remap types.  From the main interface,
select "Remap Types" from the Tools menu to open a dialog box.  From
here, he may add additional remappings between types.  Note that
sediffx will only list types that have not been implicitly remapped.
