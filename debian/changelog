setools (2.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "symlink error on /usr/share/setools/seaudit-report.conf",

setools (2.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Since we have flex scanners built into our libapol shared libraries,
    and that needs to link with the flex library, which is static;
    therefore we need to explicitly link with libfl_pic, which has the
    position independent code required for all components of a shared
    library.  
  * Split up setools into multiple packages, so that the shared libraries
    and devel tools can be provided separately. Split up the single
    package setools into several library packages, since it was pointed
    out to me that the package was in violation of §8.2 of the Debian
    policy.  Now each library has a runtime and a dev package, so each
    library can develop at its own pace.
  * Bug fix: "setools: FTBFS (amd64): libfl.a(libyywrap.o): relocation
    R_X86_64_32 against `a local symbol' can not be used when making a
    shared object; recompile with -fPIC", thanks to Andreas Jochens
                                                        (Closes: #373170).
  * Bug fix: "setools: Please adjust SELinux spelling to that of other
    SELinux-related packages", thanks to Sven Mueller   (Closes: #376613).
  * Provide md5sums
  * Also, tweak some file paths to better reflect a default Debian
    installation.

setools (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
      * libsefs:
        Converted to use an on-disk SQLite database backend and 
          re-designed API to provide the functionality to other 
          applications, such as apol.
      * libapol:
        Added support for analyzing direct file relabels.
        Added support for analyzing relationship between two types.
        Integrated use of hashtable structures for easily analyzing
          differences between policies.
        Minor bug fixes.
      * libseuser:
        Minor bug fixes.
      * apol:
        New analysis module for performing direct file relabel
          analysis.
        New analysis module for analyzing the relationship be-
          tween two types.
        New interface added for viewing file contexts from an
          SELinux filesystem.
        Improvements to domain transition analysis interface.
        Minor bug fixes and GUI tweaks.
      * secmds:
        Updated indexcon/searchcon to use an on-disk SQLite database 
          in order to decrease memory use. These changes are not
          backwards-compatible.
      * seaudit:
        Integrated reporting functionality into GUI.
        Minor GUI tweaks.
      * sediff:

          differences between two policies. The semantic difference 
          of a policy is different from the syntactic difference in 
          that it shows the cumulative effect of rules rather than 
          doing a line-by-line comparison.
