.SH SYNOPSIS
.B seinfo
[OPTIONS] [EXPRESSION] [POLICY ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B seinfo
allows the user to query the components of a SELinux policy.
.SH POLICY
.PP
.B
seinfo
supports loading a SELinux policy in one of three formats.
.IP "source"
A single text file containing policy source for versions 12 through 21. This file is usually named policy.conf.
.IP "binary"
A single file containing a monolithic kernel binary policy for versions 15 through 21. This file is usually named by version - for example, policy.20.
.IP "modular"
A list of policy packages each containing a loadable policy module. The first module listed must be a base module.
.PP
If not provided
.B
seinfo
will search for the system default policy, checking first for a source policy, then a binary policy matching the running kernel's preferred version, then finally the highest version that can be found.
If no policy can be found
.B
seinfo
will print an error message and exit.
.SH EXPRESSIONS
.P
One or more of the following component types may be specified to query. Each option may only be provided once.

about that component; if a particular component specified does not support expanded information,
then this flag will be ignored for that component (see -x below). If no expression is provided, print only statistics (see -s below).

With -x, print a list of permissions for each object class printed.
.IP "-t[NAME], --types[=NAME]"
Print a list of types (not including aliases or attributes) or, if NAME is provided, print the type NAME if it exists.
With -x, print a list of attributes which include each type printed.
.IP "-a[NAME], --attribs[=NAME]"
Print a list of type attributes or, if NAME is provided, print the attribute NAME if it exists.
With -x, print a list of types assigned to each attribute printed.
.IP "-r[NAME], --roles[=NAME]"

With -x, print the default state of each conditional boolean printed.
.IP "-S[NAME], --sensitivities[=NAME]"
Print a list of sensitivities or, if NAME is provided, print the sensitivity NAME if it exists.
With -x, print the corresponding level statement for each sensitivity printed.
.IP "-C[NAME], --categories[=NAME]"
Print a list of categories or, if NAME is provided, print the category NAME if it exists.
With -x, print a list of sensitivities with which each category printed may be associated.
.IP "-f[TYPE], --fs_use[=TYPE]"
Print a list of fs_use statements or, if TYPE is provided, print the statement for filesystem TYPE if it exists.
There is no expanded information for this component.
.IP "-g[TYPE], --genfscon[=TYPE]"
Print a list of genfscon statements or, if TYPE is provided, print the statement for the filesystem TYPE if it exists.
There is no expanded information for this component.
.IP "-n[NAME], --netifcon[=NAME]"
Print a list of netif contexts or, if NAME is provided, print the statement for interface NAME if it exists.
There is no expanded information for this component.
.IP "-o[ADDR], --nodecon[=ADDR]"
Print a list of node contexts or, if ADDR is provided, print the statement for the node with address ADDR if it exists.
There is no expanded information for this component.
.IP "-p[PORT],  --portcon[=PORT]"
Print a list of port contexts or, if PORT is provided, print the statement for port PORT if it exists.
There is no expanded information for this component.
.IP "-lPROTO,  --protocol=PROTO"

.IP "-i[NAME], --initialsid[=NAME]"
Print a list of initial SIDs or, if NAME is provided, print the initial SID NAME if it exists.
With -x, print the context assigned to each SID printed.
.IP "-A, --all"
Print all components.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-x, --expand"
Print additional details for each component matching the expression.
These details include the types assigned to an attribue or role and the permissions for an object class.
This option is not available for all component types; see the description of each component for the details this option will provide.
