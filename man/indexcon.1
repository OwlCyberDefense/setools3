.TH indexcon 1
.SH NAME
indexcon \- SELinux file context indexing tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B indexcon
FILE [OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B indexcon
allows the user to index the file contexts on a SELinux system,
beginning with the root directory (
.B
/
) and recursing into subdirectories.
The index will be written to FILE.
The index can be searched using apol or findcon.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-d DIR, --directory=DIR"
Start scanning at directory DIR, and recurse through its subdirectories.
.IP "-h, --help"
Print help information and exit.
.IP "-V, --version"
Print version information and exit.
.SH NOTE
The indexcon utility always operates on "raw" SELinux file contexts.
If the system has an installed translation library (i.e., libsetrans),
those translations are ignored in favor of reading the original
contexts from the filesystem.
