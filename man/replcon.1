.TH replcon 1
.SH NAME
replcon \- SELinux file context replacement tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B replcon
[OPTIONS] -c OLD NEW FILENAMES
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B replcon 
allows the user to find and replace file contexts.  Replacements can be restricted by object class.
.PP 
A context may be specified as a colon separated list of user, role, and type as follows - user_u:object_r:type_t. If your system supports MLS you can also add an additional MLS range to the end as follows - user_u:object_r:type_t:s0. The tool will automatically match a user, role, type, or range that is not specified, with any other user, role, type, or range. If your system has MLS and the translation library is enabled matching is done using it. If you want the tool to match raw contexts please use --raw option.
