Understanding types relationship summary analysis
-------------------------------------------------
The types relationship summary analysis in apol is a convenience
mechanism to allow a user to quickly do several queries and analyses
already in present in apol to understand the relationship between two
types.  It is meant to quickly display the relationship between two
types and therefore does not include all of the options present in the
standard queries and analyses.  The analyses are grouped into two
categories: Basic and Analysis.


Basic
-----
The basic group includes several rule searches that can be performed
using the Policy Rules tab.

  Common Attributes: the attributes common to both types.

  Common Roles: the roles to which both types are assigned.

  Common Users: the users allowed associate with roles to which both
  types are assigned.

  Similar Access to Resources: object types to which both types have
  some access.

  Dissimilar Access to Resources: object types to which one type has
  some access but the other type has none.

  TE Allow Rules: rules that provide direct access between both types.

  Type Transition / Change Rules: type_* rules that allow transitions
  between both types.


Analysis
--------
The analysis group includes several other analyses that can be
performed using the Analysis tab.

  Direct Flows Between A and B: direct information flow analysis between
  the two types.

  Transitive Flows A->B: transitive information flows from type A to B.

  Transitive Flows B->A: transitive information flows from type B to A.

  Domain Transitions A->B: domain transitions allowed from type A to B.

  Domain Transitions B->A: domain transitions allowed from type B to A.
