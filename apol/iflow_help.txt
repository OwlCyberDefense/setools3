AN OVERVIEW OF INFORMATION FLOW ANALYSIS
apol, version 2.1
August 26, 2005
selinux@tresys.com


Apol supports the ability to automate the search for overt
information flows between two types.  The purpose  of this analysis is
to identify undesirable or unexpected flows of  information allowed by
a type enforcement (TE) policy.  For example, imagine that the type
shadow_t is assigned to the shadow password file /etc/shadow. You
might be interested to know all the types to which information can
flow from the shadow_t type (e.g, indicating possible paths for
encrypted passwords to be unintentionally leaked). In this case you
would do a "flow from" analysis on the shadow_t type. Another example
might be a firewall application where your intent is to understand
all flows allowed between two network interfaces.

Information flow analysis in SELinux is challenging for several reasons, 
including:

  + The TE policy mechanism is extremely flexible, allowing for good and 
    bad flows to be easily specified, not necessarily as part of the 
    policy writer's intent.
    
  + TE policies tend to be complex, with possibly tens of thousands of 
    rules and hundreds of types, making it difficult for a policy
    writer to know all that is allowed.
  
  + SELinux currently supports 30 object classes and 122 object 
    permissions, each of which must be examined with their ability to 
    allow information flow from/to its associated object class.
    
In the remainder of this file we provide an overview on how apol 
performs information flow analysis.


WHAT IS OVERT INFORMATION FLOW IN SELINUX?

Information flow is defined in terms of access allowed (not necessarily 
whether that access is actually used).  In SELinux, all objects and 
subjects have an associated type.  Generally speaking, subjects can read 
or write objects, and thereby cause information to flow into and out of 
objects, and into and out of themselves.  For example, suppose you had two 
types (say subject_t and object_t), and you had a subject (with 
subject_t type) able to read, but not write an object (with object_t 
type), then a rule that would allow this access might look like the 
following:

	allow subject_t object_t : {file link_file} read;

In this case, you would have the following direct information flows for 
the types subject_t and object_t:

	subject_t: FROM object_t
	
	object_t:  TO subject_t
	
If this were the only rule relating to these two types, then there would 
be no other direct information flows from or to either.

Notice that an information flow can only occur when a subject is 
involved; you cannot have a flow directly between two objects since a 
subject is required to cause action.  In SELinux, processes are 
generally the subject.  There are currently 30 object classes (including 
processes, which are both subjects and objects).

In apol, the subject is easy to recognize; any type that is used in the 
'source' field of an allow rule is presumed to be associated with a 
subject (usually as the domain type of some process).  The object type 
is the type used in the 'target' field of an allow rule.  

In the case of objects, the allow rule also explicitly identifies the 
object classes for which the rule applies.  This fact results in a 
complication for analyzing information flows; specifically that flows 
between types are restricted by object classes.  A flow between types 
is typically not allowed for all object classes, but for only those 
classes identified.  So to be more precise, the direct information flows 
allowed by the object rules for object_t in the example above are:

	object_t [file, link_file]:  TO subject_t 
	
Notice the perspective difference between source (subject) 
types and target (object) types.  A read permission between a source 
type and a target type is a flow out of the target (which is being read) 
and flow into the source (which, being a process, is receiving the data 
being read into its memory).


OBJECT PERMISSION MAPPINGS

Notice in the above examples we used 'read' permission, but described 
flows as 'in' or 'out' or 'from' and 'to'.  In general for information 
flow analysis, the only access between subjects and objects that are of 
interest, are read and write.  Remembering the perspective difference 
mentioned above, read and write access results in the following flow for 
subjects (sources) and objects (targets):

	SUBJECT: READ:  IN flow
	         WRITE: OUT flow
	          
	OBJECT:  READ:  OUT flow
	         WRITE: IN flow
	        
   NOTE: Remember that a process can be either a subject or an object. So 
   when the process object class is specified in the allow rule, then 
   the target type is associated with process object class and the 
   object flow rules apply.
	
While read and write access are the only access rights of interest for 
an information flow analysis, that does not mean that 'read' and 'write' 
permissions are the only SELinux permissions of interest.  The name of a 
permission does not necessarily imply whether it allows read or write 
access.  Indeed we need to map all defined permissions for all object 
classes to read and write access in order to perform an information flow 
analysis.

This mapping can be a difficult chore, and certainly requires extensive 
understanding of the access allowed by each of the 122 permissions 
currently defined.  For example, the file object class has the 'getattr' 
permission defined which allows the ability to determine information 
about a file (such as date created and size).  One could consider this a 
read access since the subject is reading information about the file. 
Then again this begins to feel like COVERT information flow analysis, 
where one is concerned about illicit signaling of information through 
non-traditional means (e.g., signaling the critical data by varying the 
size of file is a covert flow, writing the data directly in the file so 
it can be read is an overt flow). This type of decision must be made for 
each defined object permission for each defined object class.  

The permission mapping mechanism in apol allows each permission to be 
mapped to read, write, both, or none.  In addition, the tool attempts to 
'fix' a permission map to fit the needs of the currently opened policy. 
So for example, if a permission map file does not map a set of 
permissions, or skips an entire object class, apol will label the 
missing permissions to "unmapped" and treat them as if they were mapped 
to 'none.'  Likewise if a map has permissions that are undefined in the 
current policy, it will ignore those mappings.  In this way apol 
continues its tradition of supporting old and new versions of policies 
(see below for more on managing permission maps).

The default SELinux policy provides an existing mapping for each 
permission used for the optional MLS access control feature (which 
enforces a strict, non-flexible form of overt information flow 
controls).  Most people do not use the MLS access control feature (nor 
does apol provide support to analyze the associated optional policy 
features).  However, you can use the policy 'mls' file to get at least a 
starting permission map.  Under the Advanced menu, there is a tool that 
will allow you to take a policy mls file and convert it into the 
permission mapping file format required by apol.

As distributed, apol provides default permission mappings (for policy 
version 12 through policy version 17). These files are directly 
converted from their respective policy mls files.

   NOTE: It has often been noted on the mail list that the mls file is 
   not necessarily a perfect, or even good permission map.  In addition, 
   a permission mapping good for MLS security may not necessarily be 
   good for type enforcement information flow analysis.  We leave it up 
   to others to create better permission maps. 
   
Apol provides mechanisms to allow you to manage and customize permission 
mappings that best suit your needs.  These tools, including a 
permission map editor, are all available under the Advanced menu (see 
more on this topic below).

PERMISSION WEIGHTING

In addition to mapping each permission to read, write, both, or none it is 
possible to assign the permission a weight between 1 and 10 (the default is 10). 
This weight is used to rate the importance of the information flow this 
permission represents and allows the user to make fine-grained distinctions 
between high-bandwidth, overt information flows and low-bandwidth, or difficult 
to use covert information flows. For example, the permissions "read" and "write" 
on the file object could be given a weight of 10 because it is a very high-
bandwidth information flow. Additionally, the "use" permission on the fd object 
(file descriptor) would probably be given a weight of 1 because it is a very 
low-bandwidth covert flow at best. Note that a permission might be important for 
access control, like fd use, but be given a low weight for information flow 
because it cannot be used to pass large amounts of information.

The default permission maps that are installed with Apol have weights assigned 
for all of the permissions. The weights are in four general categories as 
follows:

	1 � 2		difficult to exploit covert flows (example: fd:use)
	3 � 5		less difficult to exploit covert flows (example: process:signal)
	6 � 7		difficult to use, noisy, or low-bandwidth overt flows (example: file:setattr)
	8 � 10		high-bandwidth overt flows (example: file:write)

These categories are loosely defined and the placement of the permissions into 
these categories is subjective. Additional work needs to be done to verify the 
accuracy of both the mappings of the permissions and the assigned weights.

These weights are used in transitive information flow analysis to rank the 
results and to make certain that important paths between types are presented 
first. For example, consider a policy with the following information flows:

	allow one_t two_t : file write;
	allow three_t two_t : file read;
	allow one_t three_t : fd use;

If the permissions were mapped as described above and an analysis of the 
transitive flows from one_t to three_t were done, the analysis would return the 
path one_t->two_t->three_t first because the read and write permissions have a 
much higher weight. The direct flow between one_t and three_t would still be 
returned by the find more flows, but it would appear later in the list of flows.


TYPES OF INFORMATION FLOW ANALYSIS

In the examples so far, we've only looked at 'direct' information
flows. As its name implies, direct information flow analysis examines a policy 
for information flows that are directly permitted by one or more allow 
rules.  In essence, every allow rule defines a direct information flow 
between the source and target types (for those allowed permissions that 
map to read, write, or both).  The direct information flow analysis 
automates the search for these direct flows.

Transitive information flow analysis attempts to link together a series 
of direct information flows to find an indirect path in which information 
can flow between two types.  The results for a transitive closure will 
show one or more steps in the chain required for information to flow 
between the start and end types.  Currently, the results will only show 
one such path for each end type; specifically the shortest path.

As an example, examine the following rules:

	allow one_t two_t : file write;
	allow three_t two_t: file read;
	
If you were doing a direct flow analysis between one_t and three_t, you 
would not find any flows since no rule explicitly allows access between 
them.  However, there is a two-step flow that would allow flow between 
these two types, namely one_t writing information into a file type 
(two_t) that three_t can read.  These are the types of flows that the 
transitive analysis attempts to find.

For both analyses, the results are presented in a less-than-desirable 
tree form (a more natural form might be a graph presentation; presently 
we are not prepared for that type of investment into the GUI).   Each 
node in the tree represents a flow (in the direction selected) between 
the type of the parent node and the type of the node. The results window 
will show details about the flow, including links to the rule(s) that 
allow the flow.

MANAGING PERMISSION MAPPINGS

The ability to directly manage permission maps is important for the 
following reasons: 

  + Permission maps are central to analyzing information flows, and the 
    correctness of the map has a direct influence on the value of the 
    results;
   
  + The mapping for individual permissions and object classes are 
    subjective, and changing permissions to alter the analysis might be 
    necessary (e.g., by unmapping certain object classes to remove them 
    from the analysis); and 
    
  + You might be trying to work with several different policies each 
    with different definitions of object classes and permissions.
    
    
Because of these reasons, apol was designed to provide great latitude in 
managing permission mappings using the Advanced->Permission Mappings 
menus.  A user need not manage permission maps directly.  Apol is 
equipped with default permission maps (in /usr/share/setools/) that 
will be loaded automatically when an information flow analysis is 
performed. 

With The Advanced menus, you can manually load a permission map from any 
file location.  In this way you can keep several versions of permission 
map files around, and then load the one you want for the analysis you're 
currently doing.  You can also take a 'mls' file and generate a 
permission map file.  In addition, you can manually load the default 
permission map (see below).

There are two ways to edit the mappings in a permission map: 
1) edit a map file directly, or 2) use the permission map editor under 
the Advanced menu.  The editor will display all the object classes and 
permissions currently mapped (or unmapped) in the currently loaded 
policy.  Additionally, the editor displays weight values for each
permission. These values tell apol the importance of each permission
to the analysis. The user can configure these weight values according 
to the goals of his or her analysis. For example, the user may consider
any read or write permissions of highest importance to the analysis, 
whereas permission to use a file descriptor may be of least importance.
A permission will default to a weight of 10, if a weight value is not
provided for the permission in the permission map. 

Since apol will adapt a permission map file to meet the needs 
of a loaded policy, the loaded map may be different than the file on 
disk.  If you save the loaded map, the on-disk file will be changed to 
match the loaded map.

If you make changes to the default permission map, you can choose to  
save it as your default permission map (i.e. $HOME/.apol_perm_mapping).  
If .apol_perm_mapping exists, it will be used as your default.  
Otherwise the system default from /usr/share/setools will be used as 
the default.

   NOTE: Only one permission map may be loaded at a time, and only if a 
   policy.conf file is opened.  If you have performed an information 
   flow analysis, the default permission map will be loaded 
   automatically unless you previously manually loaded a permission map. 
   Loading a new permission map will unload the current map. Closing the 
   policy will also unload the map.		
		
FINDING MORE FLOWS

For a transitive information flow there might be many different
information flows between two types. For example, consider the
following policy:

	allow one_t two_t : file write;
	allow three_t two_t: file read;
	allow four_t two_t: file read;
	allow four_t three_t: file write;

In this policy there are two ways that information can flow
between one_t and three_t: through three_t and through
three_t and four_t. In complicated policies there can be
many information flows between two types, but the initial
transitive information flow analysis might not find all of
them. For example, apol might only find the flow through
three_t and four_t initially in the policy above. Apol
provides a means to find more information flows between two
types after the inital analysis is completed. In the
results display for an end type there is a link labeled
"Find More Flows". Clicking on the link will bring up a
dialog box that allows you to set a maximum time duration
and a maximum number of flows. Finding all of the paths
between two types can take a practically infinite amount of
time for a complicated policy, so this dialog allows you to
set limits on the search. The search will stop when either
of the limits are met. After the search completes the
additional paths will be displayed in the same results tab. 
Note that if a large number of flows are found it may take
the gui several seconds to render the text.
