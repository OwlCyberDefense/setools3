    2.0.23.

  * Fix to libqpol for policies lacking genfscon statements; for
    policies containing disabled aliases; for
    qpol_type_get_alias_iter() given certain policies; for the special
    role object_r.

    that have not had their neverallow rules loaded.

  * Fix to libsefs and apol for invalid regular expressions.

  * Fix to apol when validating empty levels.

  * Fix to all SWIG generated wrappers for Java.

==================================================

SETools 3.3.1:

This release corrects a number of issues present in SETools 3.3:

  * Fix to configure when Tcl is not found on build system; fix when
    compiling with --disable-gui option.

  * Fix to uninstall targets of Java wrappers.

  * Fix to libapol where transitive flows could return results that
    were supposed to be excluded; fixed memory leaks in infoflow graph
    generation.

  * Fix to libsefs when running MLS query on non-MLS fclists.

  * Fix to apol when reading older .apol files; fix copy and select
    all on certain tabs; fix to filter by attribute on some advanced
    dialogs.

==================================================

SETools 3.3:

SETools:

  * SETools now has an external dependency upon libsqlite3 >= 3.2.  The
    supplied configure script will enforce this dependency.

  * pkg-config scripts are installed with the SETools libraries.

libsefs:

  * Rewrite of library to have proper namespaces and much more usable
    object-oriented design.

  * SWIG wrappers generated for this library if the appropriate
    configure flags are set.

findcon, searchcon:

  * Merge searchcon's functionality into findcon.  The searchcon tool
    has been removed from SETools.

indexcon, replcon:

  * Updated to use new libsefs design.

apol:

  * Updated to use new libsefs design.

  * Modified to use the SWIG Tcl interface rather than a custom C
    library.  apol is now a combination of a Tcl script (simply called
    'apol') and associated packages that are required at runtime.

  * Neverallow rules are only loaded and expanded when the user
    performs a search for them.  This will dramatically speed up
    initial policy load time.

awish:

  * awish is no longer needed and thus has been removed from SETools.

sediff, sediffx:

  * Instead of differentiating "AV rules" or "TE rules", user now
    specifies which particular rule to compare (allow, dontaudit,
    type_transition, etc.).

  * Neverallow rules are only loaded and expanded when the user
    performs a diff upon them.  This will dramatically speed up
    initial policy load time.

==================================================

SETools 3.2:

libapol, libqpol, libesaudit, libpoldiff:

  * If --enable-swig-python is given during configure time, the build
    system will create Python SWIG wrappers for these libraries.

  * If --enable-swig-java is given during configure time, the build
    system will create Java SWIG wrappers for these libraries.

libpoldiff:

  * Provides ability to diff levels, categories, and range_transition
    statements.  Provides ability to diff modifications to a user's
    default level and permitted MLS range, assuming the policies are MLS.
    
apol, seaudit, sediffx:

  * Introduces 'policy list', a small text file that contains
    references to a base policy and any number of modules.  After
    selecting the base policy and modules in a tool's open policy
    dialog, click on 'Export' to write a policy list to disk.  That
    policy list then may be imported into the same tool or any other
    graphical SETools application.  This file also may be specified
    on the command line for all tools that load a policy.

sesearch, apol:

  * Provides full support for version 21 policy (i.e., object classes for
    range_transition statements).

sediff:

  * Shows MLS diffs.

sediffx:

  * Shows MLS diffs.

  * Provides option to show line numbers that contributed just to a
    specific AV rule's permission by clicking that AV rule's permissions.
    This is in addition to existing sediffx behavior that showed all lines
    associated with a particular rule difference.

  * Provides support for type joins and splits within the type remap dialog.

==================================================

SETools 3.1:

SETools:

  * All tools that open a policy now support loadable policy modules.
    Command line tools expect the first module to be a base module
    followed optionally by any other modules.  Graphical tools have
    a new open policy dialog to select a base module and any number of
    additional modules.

  * Release of RPM packages that are compatible with Fedora Core 5 and
    6.  The spec and support files are in packages/rpm.

libapol:

  * New class apol_policy_path_t to represent a base policy and any
    number of modules.  Use this whenever referring to the file or
    files constituting a policy.
  
libqpol:

  * Policy features such as attribute names or MLS can now be queried
    individally via qpol_policy_has_capability() rather than inferred
    by policy type and version.

  * New class qpol_module_t to represent a particular policy module
    prior to it being linked into a base policy (qpol_policy_t).

libseaudit:

  * Rewrite of library to have proper namespaces.  libseaudit is now
    fully documented and suitable for third-party users.

seaudit:

  * Rewrite to use new libseaudit.

  * Numerous tweaks to the interface to be more user friendly.

seaudit-report:

  * Rewrite to use new libseaudit.

sediffx:

  * Numerous tweaks to the interface to be more user friendly.

==================================================

SETools 3.0.1

SETools:

  * All code has been indented uniformly via the 'make indent' target.

SETools libraries:

  * All libraries now have a get_version() function.

libqpol:

  * Syntactic rule table is now off by default; it requires an
    explicit call to qpol_policy_build_syn_rule_table() to create it.

libapol:

  * apol_policy_t is now an opaque structure.  apol_permmap_t is no
    longer a public declaration.

  * avrule and terule queries now have full "syntactic" searching
    features.

apol & sesearch:

  * If loaded policy is source, the new syntactic search algorithm is used.

==================================================

SETools 3.0

SETools:

  * Moved entire project to autoconf build system.  This will detect
    dependencies correctly and make it easier to integrate with Linux
    distributions and their packaging systems.

SETools libraries:

  * Rewrite of back-end of SETools to use libsepol data structures.
    Most things should run notably faster.

  * All exported library functions have a standardized naming
    convention and are fully documented.  This will prove helpful for
    third-party developers integrating SETools into their own
    projects.

  * For policies version 15 or greater, domain transition analysis now
    takes into consideration setexec permission and/or type_transition
    rules.

apol:

  * Rework Tk interface to fit on 1024x768 displays.

  * Indirect matching of attributes now works with rule searches.

sediff:

  * New diffing algorithm yields significant speed improvements.

  * Can now diff neverallow and role_transition statements.

  * Streamlined results display - should be easier to read.

sechecker:

  * Updated module format and template for ease of extension.
